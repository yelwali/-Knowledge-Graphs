# Personalized Knowledge Graphs

This project focuses on building personalized knowledge graphs to enhance the contextualization of communications. These graphs capture user-specific data, including background, interaction patterns, and inferred personality traits, providing a foundation for more accurate and meaningful communication.

## Features

- **User Background Representation**: Collect and organize information about each user's background.
- **Interaction Patterns**: Analyze and incorporate user behavior and communication styles.
- **Personality Traits**: Infer personality traits to adapt communication context dynamically.
- **Enhanced Contextualization**: Leverage knowledge graphs to provide tailored communication insights.

## Use Cases

- **Improved Communication Systems**: Enhance understanding in chatbots, virtual assistants, and customer support.
- **Social Media Analysis**: Detect patterns in user interactions for targeted recommendations or moderation.
- **Behavioral Analysis**: Study user behavior for applications in marketing, education, or healthcare.
