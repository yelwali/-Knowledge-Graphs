This is a weak hadith because it is mursal (disconnected). Yunus bin Maysarah bin Halbas, who narrated the hadith from the Prophet ﷺ, though a trustworthy; however, he is from the Tabi‘un, and the _**mursal is considered weak due to its disconnection**_, as is well known.

But OP, I found that the latter part of your post in layman terms essentially boiled down to “the militaries of English countries also do a lot of bad, so they are the real terrorists and not Muslim ones”. This rhetoric is extremely untrue. Yes, it’s a possibility that they’re using religion to brainwash, but look at the ground level situation. Ground level terrorists who do the actual dirty work still do it believing they’re doing it for their religion. So how is religion not a cause here? 
  
Additionally, even if we go forward with the statement that religion is a tool and not a cause, they why is only one specific religion being used as a tool? The simple reason is because that religion has provisions for taking action against things you believe are against the order of God, things that are dictated by a book but can be misinterpreted by people with their own agenda and thus used as a tool to further their own cause. 
  
  
Overall, I’d say the write up by OP is good but at a lot of points it seems they have really tried running a lot of circles to avoid having to spell out certain things that are simply unrefutable.
  
  
Edit : OP’s account is a bit sus. This is the only post on their account, and a single comment, that too on this post itself.

OP starts by saying that this is not a defense of religion and then goes on and on defending Islam and finding all kinds of excuses for Islamic terrorism and its connection with religion. And blaming USA - without it, no Indian left argument is ever complete. 

1) claim 1: terrorism (Taliban, ISIS types) have nothing to do with religion but it a drive for power and money

Osama had lot more power and money as part of bin laden family as compared to so going to Afghanistan and running a militia. If money and power were things al zawahari wanted, an eye surgeon has much more prospects rather than no 2 of a militia.

A lot of aid (money) can come to Afghanistan to Europe if Taliban agrees to basic education and rights for women. More countries will recognise Taliban as legitimate rulers is Afghanistan and reduce sanctions if Taliban can recognise basic human rights. But Taliban refuses to do so because it's interpretation of Islam doesn't allow it to grant such rights. If money and power is all you want, why blow up Buddha carvings.

**Today, Taliban has all the power in Afghanistan. Will it cover itself into a liberal democracy with human rights to get more money and power?**

The same story with ISIS. All their actions are justified by religion, not money and power. Why Blow up pre-islamic archeological sites which can get you money via tourism? Also, sex slavery and genocide of yezidi people makes sense via religion, not power and money. 

2) claim 2: religion is a tool for terrorist and their goal is to extent their power and not spread religion. 

Rather violence is a tool that an islamic terrorist wants to use to defend his religion. 

3) imperialism, European armies are real terrorist etc

It is not as though Islamic brown and black countries don't have armies and those armies dont commit atrocities. 

4) Gaza

It is only important for us because our Muslim population feels sympathy for their co-religion followers especially when they are getting their ass kicked by their religious enemy. Sudan, Azerbaijan -armenia, russia-ukraine, Somalia etc have much bigger humanitarian crisis. So did Sri Lanka a decade and half ago. 

5) farmers protests and death: were farmers shot and killed by police? No.  Did they die of hunger? No. In the middle of COVID, they did a protest. And made some of the dumbest arguments ever - govt should procure all they produce at a rate determined by cost.

like the example I provided of sikh pogroms in 1984. Who killed those sikhs? and why did they do it?

every religion is used like that, do you disagree that there are hindu terrorists or christians or zionists like mentioned above?

Ironically the reforms weren't made by Hindus themselves. But one of silver linings came from the brutal colonization of the British Empire. So much so, that some nutjobs believe that Britishers introduced the caste system in Hinduism.

It's not lol. Moon landing & flat earthers don't really affect foreign policy,. This does.

 Ottoman Empire was literally distributed by the British, after they lost in WW1.

Malaysia has a pretty liberal way of governance, except for the last 20 years with the rise of intolerance from top leadership. 

>What is stopping Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Iran, etc to do reforms now ? They are not under occupation or anything.

Ahh this is cute, invade them for years, and when they go free in the last 20-50 years, ask them . Why you like this? Compare to 100-200 + years of stability in Christian countries.

Such a stupid argument again. I literally told you that American Evangelicals are controlling US foreign policy, what's stopping them from reforming Christianity?

Ottoman Empire ruled for centuries before the British Empire even came into existence. So what stopped Ottoman Empire (which even controlled Mecca and Medina at the height of its power) to reform Islam ?

I lived in Malaysia for 5+ years and while it’s the most liberal Muslim country (I.e. as liberal as a Muslim can get), it has enshired racism in its constitution. Here are some salient features of it :-

1) Islam is the state religion
2) You have to convert to Islam if you want to marry a Muslim I.e. Islamist supremacy
3) You cannot convert out of Islam and while you definitely can convert into Islam
4) Bumiputra laws gives special rights and Muslims to Malay Muslims over non-Muslims
5) The head of the government always have to be a Muslim although the country is only 67% Muslim
6) The non-Muslim Malaysians are actively emigrating out of Malaysia to escape biased Muslim laws and thereby the percentage of Muslim population is increasing

Should I go on ? If this is the condition of the most liberal  Muslim county which was not involved in in any war in last 7 decades and got independence within 10 years of Indian independence then surely Islam and Muslim need reforms more than those sorry excuses you are giving

And you conveniently avoided the blasphemy issues with Islam and need for open discussions about Islam and Mohammad without the threat of being beheaded or actually being killed.",-1

>It seems you need some basic history fact checks. Ottoman Empire ruled for centuries before the British Empire ever came into existence. So what stopped Ottoman Empire (which even controlled Mecca and Medina at the height of its power) to reform Islam ?

Bruh, so stupidity 😭. Centuries as an ""Empire"", with a king and sh""t. Not as a nation, and have you read that these gunpowder empires were preceded by the Islamic Golden Age, which had economic, cultural & scientific temperament, so if Islam is the sole reason, how come it had such nuances? Because there was stability. Which no Muslim country had for a long time after they became a nation.

>it has enshired racism in its constitution. Here are some salient feature of it :-

Have you read Israel laws? How regressive and racist they are? And that despite being a new nation pretending to be a ""democracy"" while having ethno-state as Jewish religion as the core. 

And forget Israel have seen the anti-conversion laws in India? Google it, you'll have a cultural shock at the tolerance levels.

And funnily enough, I'll be even less bigoted than you and explain that all these laws of Malaysia, Israel, India etc. have nothing to go with religion, but a way to control demography as to maintain a control through it, not because of it. 

Again, religious reforms are completely unrelated to the political/societal history of a country. You are again fishing for easy answer, and being intellectually lazy.



>And you conveniently avoided the blasphemy issues with Islam and need for open discussions about Islam and Mohammad without the threat of being beheaded or actually being killed.

The reason I avoided this is precisely because you want to equate islamic reforms to the political violence done in its name, completely ignoring OP's post & again wind the clock back to stupid arguments instead of understanding the political societal history. Good luck baiting others.",-1

Equating most liberal Muslim country which has seen no wars in last 7 decades with a Jewish country in the most volatile region in the world which sees war every other year. Thatz as Islamic apologist as one can get.

And you are bending over backwards to defend Islamist supremacy and racism enshrined in Malaysian constitution. How will you react if Indian constitution had same provisions ?

Reform is Islam is fundamental to progress among Muslims. And to openly debate criticise a religion and prophets are a pre cursor to it. If you beat around the bush and avoid the elephant in the room then you will look for hyperbolic logic that you are giving here.

If majority of the population are being taught from childhood about absurd stories and prophecies and they threaten with death when they try to question it then it’s no brainer that community will not progress according to mordern standard and hence will easily be the “tools” for other powers.

So being a “tool” is the effect while being not open to scientific discussion about religion and prophets is the cause.",0

Vladimir Putin, who initially tried to direct suspicion towards Ukraine, is now also convinced of this.

As a result of the general threat, the highest security level has now been declared in France.

Swedes, Indians and Americans are also among the most worried.

The truth is, the vast vast majority of immigrants are not terrorists and the number of terrorist incidents perpetrated by immigrants is tiny compared to the number of immigrants. Yet somehow, this group of millions of people, most of whom just want a better life, are labeled in your minds as dangerous terrorists, jihadists, fanatics, etc, to the point that far-right wing parties are rising over the fear of something less dangerous than improperly installed furniture.

I think both are likely to have contributed.

As a side note, it's interesting that the Quran burnings were spread a lot by TRT, Turkish media. Probably connected to the fact that Turkey wanted concessions from the US to let Sweden enter Nato, and Swedish islamophobia was very convenient cover.

The November ones shouldn't be overlooked, as they were more deadly, and the images and the Bataclan's survivors tales were really shocking. Many survivors of the Bataclan are at the very least traumatized, at worst badly maimed for life.

And THEN, after this bad 2015 year, in July 2016, another terrorist attack happened in Nice, with a truck driving on a well frequented (pedestrian-only) avenue to smash as many people as possible.

Now, I can't speak for all French people but I live in Toulouse, and in 2012 we were also shocked by Mohamed Merah's terrorist attacks. He killed Jewish children out of school. I live and worked very close to his flat, where the police tactical unit sieged and killed him. I remember vividly, in the nights during the siege, hearing from my appartment the flashbangs they threw at him to keep him awake. I also remember, as I was working like any other day, hearing from afar the assault unfold. Quite weird feeling, feeling both absolutely safe, but also in close proximity to a very violent fighting zone.

Anyway, I'm sure other French people can tell you their memories of these attacks, and other ones as well.

My sister works in HR for a company that supplies people to the entertainment industry. The week after the attack, she had to tell her colleagues that 3 of their employees had died, plus their girlfriends. It was a very difficult time for everyone.



At this very moment, and even though it's undoubtedly nonsense made by kids, the inboxes of students at several high schools have been flooded with e-mails announcing an attack, complete with an attack video.

Ton point de vue est tout à fait compréhensible, peut-être es tu quelque part où le risque est trop petit pour être inquiété, ou probablement une activité professionnelle peu ou pas exposé.

Pour ma part, je suis un agent administratif en université, situé dans le nord du pays.  
Une bonne partie de nos formateurs universitaire enseignent également dans les collèges et les lycées de la région. Avec ce qu'il est récemment arrivé dans la ville d'Arras, partir du principe que cela n'affecte personne, c'est assez déplacé de ta part.  
Les agressions et surtout les menaces envers le personnel pourraient être qualifiés de fréquentes (mais pas quotidiennes, n'exagérons rien non plus).  
De plus, chaque semaine (minimum), la communication interne de l'université me rappel le niveau de vigi-pirate en cours et les règles à suivre et adopter dans certains cas. Rien qu'avec ça, il est impossible pour moi de ne pas y penser.  
  
Tu rajoute à cela, les étudiants eux-mêmes qui, lorsqu'il y a un fait d'actualité qui s'en approche (comme la très récente relevée du niveau de vigi-pirate) te demande s'il y a une sécurité mise en place pour leurs examens, en cas d'attaque.  
Il y a même des aides psychologique pour les personnels que ça ronge de l'intérieur.

Maintenant, je te pris de m'expliquer comment puis-je faire pour ignorer la menace terroriste, sachant que c'est une problématique sérieuse et concrète au sein de mon activité professionnelle ? ........ Et oui, c'est impossible.

Bien sûr, j'aimerais me rassurer en me disant que tout ça c'est du vent et rien n'arrivera jamais, mais je n'y parviens pas. Bien sûr je n'en suis pas au point de regarder tout le monde de travers ou de vérifier au dessus de mon épaule le moindre geste suspect, mais plutôt comme une idée qui te reste en tête.

Après, je ne peux pas vraiment t'en vouloir d'avoir ton point de vue ; C'est largement compréhensible. Vu le peu d'informations qu'il y a ... les ministères aiment étouffer les problèmes quand ça fait trop de bruits (à tord ET à raison).

En espérant que cela te rende plus compréhensif du quotidien de certains de tes compatriotes.",2

Weed is extremely common in France (biggest consumer in the world) despite having one of the most repressive policy. 

Cannabis traffic is deeply tied with the cités with a poor population with a migration background. 

We could get into details about the whys and hows, there's many layers to this situation. We would need to cover 60 years of policies around economy, justice, immigration and urbanism. 

That number is so staggering because it's misrepresented. The truth is French prisons are completely filled with random little dealers who mostly come from places with a lot of immigration and very few economic opportunities, while this does absolutely nothing to combat drug trafficking because the leaders are never caught and they have a neverending supply of desperate teenagers to replace those who get caught.

Edit: Also, yes. All Afghan and Persian Invasions are Muslim invasions. I hope you have this amount of basic common sense. Temples were burnt (not a big deal ngl). But the main problem came when they the invaders burnt Nalanda , trashed villages , raped mothers and sisters and chopped off the brothers. Entire granaries and treasuries were looted , work of arts destroyed and the abode of our gods besmirched.

Before this incident Hindu kings did burn each other's temples and villages but there was golden rule no one crossed i.e civilians , gurukuls and universities must not be touched at all costs.

This is current day disinformation that is very popular but false about north african immigration. **They didn't rebuild France at all**. That's literally why in France, Portuguese was synonymous with ""mason""/cobbler for a long time. People forget that racists in France used to talked about italians, spaniards and portuguese the same way they did and do arabs, it was slightly ""better"" because ""at least they're christians"". 

The immigrants that rebuilt France after WW2 were mostly Spaniards, Italians and Portuguese. They also suffered alot from racism but it's much more forgotten because they've integrated very well within french society over two generations.

Morrocans, Algerians and Tunisians mostly came after 1962. France was done rebuilding by then. While some North Africans did live in France before, it wasn't a massive phenomenon like during the 80's and 90's and was mostly a parisian phenomenon. They didn't build the suburbs they moved in, which were mostly post-war suburbs for the biggest part of it.

Also, anti-western sentiment in india is on the wane now because people see china as the number one enemy here.

Modi has largely just swept in and exploited the malaise in indian society after 70 years of rule of the indian national congress(INC). The INC was the party with which most prominent indian leaders like Gandhi, Nehru, V. Patel etc were associated. It used to be quite idealistic up until the 1970s and had been the de-facto party till the 1990s, and was still the most prominent party till 2014. 

  
The congress is a centre left secular party. It doesn't really have a set ideology apart from do what seems OK to the party leadership. It became quite out-of-touch and corrupt and so was decimated in the 2014 election. 

The BJP is a right wing party. Both the congress and the BJP sort of dance with shades of neoliberalism, welfarism and socialism. On foreign policy, there is very little difference. 

More or less, Modi stormed to power because people were dissatisfied. Politicians have been promising Gareebi Hatao(Remove poverty) since the 1970s but progress has been slow. The congress also monumentally fucked up in the 1980s by pandering to conservative muslim lobbies to reinstate some pretty fucked up things and in general perpetrating a series of violent ethnic clashes against the sikh minority. The party is so old that there are a lot of skeletons in the past, and many of those skeletons are associated with the Nehru-Gandhi family, which is still in control of the party today. Since the 1990s most governments were coalition governments, which brought a lot of instability to governance. 

  
People vote for Modi because he seems like a clean break from the past. He is seen as clean, competent if a little vain. There has also been a substantial shift in public opinion since the early 2000s. There is more and more polarization between the muslims and the hindus. Hindus see Muslims as a threat due to the wave of islamism in the mid 2010s. This is fertile ground for the BJP to consolidate its votes. 

In India, people very often vote on religious and caste lines. The Congress has typically come to power by assembling a coalition of religious minorities and lower caste hindus. The BJP comes to power by consolidating all hindu votes, across caste lines. 

  
Radical hindutva tries to consolidate India as a anti-muslim country. Political hindutva, which is what the BJP does is to consolidate the hindu and non muslim vote in general into a bloc. This has led to a number of decisions that might seem outlandish considering political conservatism, such as this: [Leader of influential Hindu group backs LGBT rights in India](https://www.reuters.com/world/india/leader-influential-hindu-group-backs-lgbt-rights-india-2023-01-11/).",2

This is true, though remember in the example, there are a decent sized crowd of them now, and they are backed by their religion and numbers. You can try handling one by one, but they are going to be reinforced by their bonds with each other. This isn’t just a one-off case of bigotry, it’s a group identity now, and these are Conservative Catholics. They are sprinting towards claiming religious intolerance and discrimination.

> When a native French is homophobic it's just ""their opinion"" but when an immigrant is homophobic it's ""their culture"". It's the argument that cultures are ""incompatible"" that's idiotic. Clearly, no ""culture"" is compatible even with itself since bigots exists everywhere.

These immigrants are refugees from third world countries with regressive laws and theocracies laced with fascism. If you’ve been taught *ALL* your life that women are property, that gays are an affront to god punishable by death…I’m sorry, but that shit sticks with you to some degree! Sure, these immigrants may not form roving death squads to beat LGBT people to death, but being discriminatory, being rude, or avoiding them like lepers? That’s going to happen, because it *WAS* their culture and intertwined with their religious identity.

Eh, careful there. We’re talking about not painting with broad strokes, this isn’t doing you any favors.

> they just want justification for why certain people shouldn't be allowed in.

I do agree that’s how cowards approach this topic, they’ll pretend to champion causes of marginalized people just so they can hate on a specific group. For some here that may be the case, but we do have lots of French in this thread with legitimate concerns. Remember what I said about ingrained religious identity sticking with some immigrants? Imagine the most fanatical considering their new home an affront to Allah. How easy are they to radicalize? These violent psychopaths are a minority of a minority, but coming from an authoritarian theocracy, the most dangerous of them are predisposed to extremist behavior, and it takes only ONE to commit an act of absolute tragedy.

> Most anti-LGBT region in Europe is Eastern Europe, how many Middle Eastern migrants have entered there compare to the western Europe? Why is no one saying ""Ukrainian culture is incompatible to the west""?

I’m sure if Ukraine wasn’t in its own war and the spotlight was on them for their transgressions against the LGBT, people would absolutely share that sentiment. I’ll ask though, out of my own ignorance, are they nearly as bad as the Middle East? Like, affront to God, kill on sight bad? Or is it bad compared to western standards, such as verbal hatred or discrimination? Not saying that’s ok, but one is a TON more manageable than others.

It talks about the factors which would allow India to sustain growth. Talks about infrastructure, investment, FDI, tax changes and some other stuff. It does list the negatives at the end but doesn't really talk about it in detail.

This is from the BBC and talks about the recent quarter. Manufacturing drove higher growth which is very good because India basically skipped the manufacturing phase and went straight to services, so getting a nice manufacturing base is important. Also talks about the budget trying to reduce the deficit.

In only 4 years the economy should be at 19 trillion (PPP). In 5 years it'll be 20 trillion plus (PPP). Very good growth.

Exports increase steadily as seen here.

India is very dependent on foreign trade. We're not even energy independent. Not as dependent as China but still a considerable amount.  Unemployment is high. It's very hard to provide employment for so many people due to the sheer amount of investment needed. It's going to take a while for things to become better.

What caused ISIS to overtake Al-Qaeda as a terror movement?,Nastyfaction,https://www.reddit.com/r/WarCollege/comments/1f4nbgv/what_caused_isis_to_overtake_alqaeda_as_a_terror/,pnzsaurkrautwerfer,"Okay so when you're dealing with Sunni extremists you're dealing with a lot of different thoughts and perspectives, but a common theme is restoring the Caliphate (a common pan-Islamic divinely guided nation although some folks go hard enough to envision just the whole world falling under Caliphate rule).  There's also two broad kinds of enemies preventing this:

Near Enemies: Apostate (wrong kind of Muslim) or Pagan (wrong kind of religion) or Atheist rulers and states in the Middle East that are oppressing their Sunni Muslim populations.

Far Enemies: Western/non-middle eastern colonial powers (US, UK, and Russia are the big ones here, although France gets honorable mention).

These concepts, Caliphate yes, far and near enemies bad, pretty universally accepted.  

Where it gets fucky is in timing:

AQ broadly thought what had to happen was the Far Enemies had to be pushed out of the Middle East/Islamic World  first.  Then countries like Egypt have no support (or at least there's no US carrier battlegroup showing up to crush the Caliphate on day zero) which let the Jihadist factions take power, then they assemble a new Caliphate as black banners go up across the Islamic World.  The logic for 9-11, to an example was drawing the US into a series of Middle Eastern conflicts that would defeat the US the same way the Afghan war broke up the USSR (AQ has a vastly inflated opinion of the role the Afghan war played in the fall of the USSR), no US in middle east, equals free hand to start up the Caliphate party.

ISIS on the other hand saw the most immediate threat as being the near enemy.  If the oppressor near enemies were defeated, the ummah (Islamic community) could then unify into a Caliphate that would then sweep across the Middle East and form a power that the West could fight and lose against.  This is reflective inflated ideas of how Western Power had declined following the Iraq War and misreading US disengagement to mean ""we're beaten"" vs ""we are so goddamned sick of this place"" 

So understanding these general differences:

AQ kind of had it's at bat.  It tried its strategy, fought it's wars, and in 2010...mostly fucking lost them.  Iraq had ended badly for the Jihadists.  Afghanistan is still a decade out from a ""win"" (and it's a Taliban win).  AQ has lost a lot of credibility because it's generally failed at what it's tried, and for the most part the status quo prevails.

Then when the Arab Spring kicks off, well shit finally the revolt against the near enemy is happening and it's....not Jihadist for the most part, let alone AQ oriented.  

It's also worth mentioning at this point that AQ is at this point, and still pretty old school.  Like their way of getting out propaganda is physical media, like VHS tapes, magazines, whatever.  

So ISIS.

There's books about this so this is kind of the Cliff Note version:

ISIS's core is actually an AQ offshoot, AQ in Iraq, they've always had more of an anti-Shia bias (this is why AQ's conflict in Iraq is so aggressively kill the Shia).  They're spun off to fight in Syria because Iraq at this point is kind of a dead issue while the Syrian Civil War was a hot spot for Jihadist groups.  

And they go, and promptly fuck off and do their own thing.  This is a longer discussion I don't have the time for.  But basically ISIS at that point is suddenly a very well disciplined, very well organized core that's there to kill apostates and chew gum, and gum is haram so I guess that's out.  

This is in contrast to AQ and a lot of other groups that are shambolically organized, or often a few steps from being bandits.  ISIS is fighting, it's winning, and then shockingly it's like ""hey so yeah fucking Caliphate NOW"" and with their initial successes....fuck man yeah it looks like they're getting it done especially once they put the Iraqi Army to flight.  For the first time in centuries of Middle Eastern history there's awfully reasonable Caliph and Caliphate stand in if you're desperate for such things.  

And at that, ISIS propaganda for us is really beheading focused...but within the Middle East it focuses on a seemingly healthy functioning Sunni focused society.  They have taxes and they are fair!  They have courts with just Islamic law!  Kids get ice cream!  Kurds are slaves like they should be!  

And for people living under Alawite bombs, or Iranian guided Iraqi government death squads, shit this is kind of appealing right?  And it doesn't hurt that ISIS is a much newer organization with the kind of people who get social media who can get the word out.

So in a time in which AQ is still sending VHSes from caves with the same old fucks (the ones the US hasn't black bagged or toe tagged) waving their idiot fingers in the air promising that SOMEDAY it'll happen for real...ISIS has a state that is comparable in scale and military capability (at least on Facebook) to it's ""neighbors"".",285
What caused ISIS to overtake Al-Qaeda as a terror movement?,Nastyfaction,https://www.reddit.com/r/WarCollege/comments/1f4nbgv/what_caused_isis_to_overtake_alqaeda_as_a_terror/,WarumUbersetzen,"I don’t have time to write a great deal here, but I’ve written about Al-Qaeda before as part of my graduate degree - ISIS was a developing phenomenon at the time but I’ve kept up with its history though I haven’t written anything academic on it. 

Basically, after 9/11, Al-Qaeda was targeted heavily by the Americans and their allies worldwide. The reason for this is obvious. 

ISIS started out as a branch of Al-Qaeda, known as Al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI) and due to the relatively decentralized nature of the AQ command structure, enjoyed a high degree of autonomy (and thus insulation) from Osama bin Laden and the others of Al-Qaeda Central. 

Abu Musab al-Zarqawi was a Jordanian insurgent who became leader of Al-Qaeda in Iraq around 2004, his group of anti-American insurgents were subsumed into Al-Qaeda, but were still recognized to be a mostly independent organization which is why they were not targeted to the same extent as the central group. Indeed - and I don’t have a specific citation for this - but there was a letter from one of bin Laden’s top lieutenants asking Zarqawi to stop killing so many Shias and also to please give them 100k USD since their finances were being attacked by the West. This quotation can be found in Fawaz A. Gerges’ book ISIS: A HISTORY.

Zarqawi, leader of AQI, had different goals from AQ Central. Chiefly, instead of targeting the American forces in Iraq, he targeted Shia Muslims. Shias are the majority of the Iraqi population.  Saddam Hussein’s Ba’ath Party was Sunni-dominated. Therefore, after the 2003 invasion and toppling of the Hussein government, Shias rose to power, which caused a lot of Sunnis to be very upset that their generational power had been taken away. Therefore, AQI found a willing and ready source of young Sunni men who resented the downturn in their fortunes and were enthused about attacking Shias. 

Zarqawi was killed before Al-Qaeda in Iraq turned into ISIS, but looking at what I’ve laid out paints a picture that answers your question. 

- Al-Qaeda was heavily targeted by the Americans to an extent that ISIS was not - this was because they carried out a successful, public, and extremely painful attack upon the United States. ISIS never carried out a 9/11 and the will to destroy them was not as present. 

 - ISIS had goals that were simultaneously large scale while also not presenting much threat to the West; while of course attacks over here dominated the news, ISIS mostly carried on in its parent organization AQI’s footsteps and focused on attacking Shias. I don’t actually think that they DO encourage attacks in the West - maybe among adherents who already live there but that’s not their main focus. 

**I’ve got to catch a flight now, I’m not super happy with this response but figured I’d put it out there. It’s missing a lot, I think. If you want to learn more, I suggest the Gerges book I mentioned. It’s written very straightforwardly and does an excellent job providing context and background to the events described.**",73
What caused ISIS to overtake Al-Qaeda as a terror movement?,Nastyfaction,https://www.reddit.com/r/WarCollege/comments/1f4nbgv/what_caused_isis_to_overtake_alqaeda_as_a_terror/,EyeIntelligent2418,"Many good replies here. One important point to make, is that AQ is definitely not gone, and is more dominant on a global level than Da3sh. For instance you have JNIM in the Sahel region who’s an AQ affiliate, or drug smuggling pirates in the Gulf of Guinea that rely on AQ relations to pass check points through out Africa in order to get drugs into mainland Europe. 

So while AQ doesn’t make as many headlines anymore, they’re not overtaken by ISIS. AQ also massively changed their funding style during COVID. Prior to COVID and actually way back to the 70s and 80s, AQ and similar organisations have been funded through sponsors, illicit NGO work and kidnappings. With Da3sh entering the “market” with the war in Iraq and Syria post-Arab spring, a big competitor took a lot of funding away from AQ.

Because almost no one travelled during COVID, income from kidnappings drastically decreased and sponsors were still favouring Da3sh. AQ then transitioned to legal NGO work and other legal methods to generate funding, one of which is app development to the Asian market.

This is also one of the reasons AQ isn’t as much in the headlines, because they run many legal business operations while supporting the Islamist/smuggling operations in Northern Africa.",15

Al-Qaeda, its primary leadership, in the wake of 911 and becoming the primary target of the US, had to lay low, ISIS, born in the brutal fighting in Iraq and, for a while, wasn't on the radar, at least not as prominently as Al-Qaeda, and filled the vacuum after the US's retreat from Iraq, just managed to win bigger prizes: for a while, it's literally a state, and it did a great deal of spectacular things that attract attention of the current generation of potential recruits, not dissimilar to aging movie star, however big he/she used to be, simply isn't as relevant as the latest A-lister, or even sometimes tik-tok influencers.



and in any case, Al-Qaeda is a brutal organization, but not really known for wonton purposeless violence, at least not nearly as much as ISIS : they did things for some, in their mind, bigger, purpose. Bin Laden came from a wealthy and prominent family, I suppose people of his background can subscribe to murderous ideologies but usually only cuz they convince themselves of some bigger purpose, usually it's not being animalistic brutal for the sake of brutality, leadership of ISIS and earlier incarnation, were led by barely educated thug who cut their teeth in the brutal Iraq war, who have entire different take on everything, sorta like old school Mafia vs street gangs: former will kill you / melt you in acid if you cross them / had something they want but latter will AK  house of strangers just they were high",6

Even widely perceived as moderate Islamic nations such as Malaysia have had official anti-Shia prejudice for decades, while occasional lethal sectarian attacks vs the Shia minority in Pakistan have been occurences since the ‘80s. The rise of increasingly hardline attitudes towards Shias have been attributed to Saudi (Wahabi) religious influences given long time official Saudi policies vs its own Shiite minority.

In the above sectarian context, the longstanding ties between Shia militancy (Iran and its Hezbollah proxy) and Hamas with its Sunni fundamentalist Muslim Brotherhood roots is something of a curiosity.",36

Al Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan were overshadowed by the Taliban, due in no small part to religious differences (Al Qaeda being a Wahhabi organization and Pashtuns being mostly Deobandi). Al Qaeda in Syria was a very small organization before the Arab Spring, and its explosive growth after 2011 was nipped in the bud when AQI invaded Syria and largely succeeded in absorbing its fighting force. In theory, Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula was the “flagship” organization, but it had a very small fighting strength before the collapse of Yemen, and even today is not large.

AQI was by far Al Qaeda’s most powerful franchise at that point, and was the one that their propaganda centered around. Their only real competition were Al-Shabaab and Boko Haram, which also sympathized with AQI’s position and eventually pledged fealty to them. ISIS’s strongest supporters outside the Fertile Crescent were other jihadi groups that had managed to establish governments, indicating a wider conflict between “territorial” jihadis and the still underground AQ leadership.",40

What was Bin Laden/Al Qaeda's gameplan?,MichaelEmouse,https://www.reddit.com/r/WarCollege/comments/13q3sh1/what_was_bin_ladenal_qaedas_gameplan/,Semi-Chubbs_Peterson,"Al Qaeda’s (AQ) roots go back the the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan in which Bin Laden fought.  As the Soviets prepared to exit, Bin Laden had a vision of an Islamic army with global reach that could unify the various Islamic groups who were fighting against their own countries’ regimes.  He had long viewed the various regimes in the Middle East as illegitimate and believed that the US presence in Saudi Arabia was an affront to Islam.  His strategy evolved to focusing on the U.S. as the primary enemy and believed that if he took the fight to us worldwide, he could force our withdrawal from the Middle East which would leave the various regimes there weakened to the point that AQ could overthrow them and solidify a great Islamic Caliphate.  It’s likely that he knew the US would respond in force and that was part of his plan.  He hoped that by fighting an insurgency against the U.S. in the Middle East, and taking advantage of Muslim sectarianism against the Shia, that the people would revolt against our occupation in the region and turn the regimes against us to the point that we had to withdraw.  

Contrast that with ISIS, which started in Iraq and was initially known as Al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI).  ISIS also had the goal of establishing an Islamic Caliphate and while they had no love for the US or the west, they preferred to focus on the Middle East and not take the fight global.  While AQ used the Shia/Sunni hatred to their advantage, AQI sought to exterminate all apostates (Shias in their mind) and used extremely brutal tactics to make that happen.  There was always tension between AQ and AQI and after the death of Bin Laden that tension only increased to the point that the two groups formally split during the Syrian campaign.

Edit:  fixed error where I said sunni but meant shia.",63
What was Bin Laden/Al Qaeda's gameplan?,MichaelEmouse,https://www.reddit.com/r/WarCollege/comments/13q3sh1/what_was_bin_ladenal_qaedas_gameplan/,None,"In the book “Ghost Wars” by Steve Coll, he writes about Bin Laden’s early years and his brushes with the CIA. Bin Laden wasn’t taken especially seriously in the 80’s during the height of the Mujahideen’s fight with the Soviet Union. He did a lot of what was essentially “Fatwa by Fax Machine” and the Muslim world just kinda rolled their eyes at him. He was popular, but in a “haha get a load of this guy, what a character!,” kind of way.

What he did do in Afghanistan was basically act as an intermediary and financier between Pakistani and Saudi intelligence and the Mujahideen. He got into a few fights to burnish his image and popularity, but he was not a fighter.

He made an offer to the Saudis to bring his army from Afghanistan to Saudi Arabia in response to the threat of invasion by Saddam, but it was rejected by the Saudis. He didn’t exactly have an army capable of resisting Saddam. He was already not popular with the Saudi royal family, having engaged in various activities that were at odds with the Saudi Arabian government. Eventually they gave him the boot, and he went to Sudan. He was never in a position to overthrow the Saudi dynasty.

The US applied considerable pressure to the Sudanese to expel him, and so did the Saudis, because he was still being an obnoxious twat and saying mean things about King Fahd. There were some assassination attempts, possibly sponsored by the CIA, apparently some retaliation against the station chief in Khartoum, and some other shenanigans. Around the time all of this was happening, the Saudis convinced his family to cut him off from his annual $7 million stipend (the Bin Laden family is mega rich from construction work). This loss of income, combined with the Sudanese government seizing his assets there worth an estimated $300 million, are the events that most consider to have fully radicalized him. He blamed the US for these events, and certainly they had a hand in Sudan’s decision. It did not help that he was implicated in the attempted assassination of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, or that Sudan really wanted to not be listed as a state sponsor of terrorism.

So back to Afghanistan he went, and he took his followers with him. He had brought about 300 former mujahideen with him and employed them in various enterprises. These followers of his were further radicalized by the events in Sudan, and while he had established Al-Qaeda years before, these men would form the core of the group that would fight alongside the Taliban against the US in 2001.

So what was his strategy? He wanted to draw the US into an expensive and un-winnable war in the Muslim world. Basically, he sought to repeat what the Mujahideen accomplished against the Soviet Union, but failed to account for the vast differences in economic power of the two nations. Or that the US would hunt him down and kill him. There isn’t much known about their plans for anything post-9/11, mainly because the leadership scattered as soon as the US started raining bombs on Afghanistan and started putting boots on the ground.

I take issues with this take because this view has mostly been what American counter-terrorism writers say about what Bin Laden's strategy is, without much evidence for it and I am certain it is purely coincidental that by saying terrorism has a grand strategic view, that provided a raison d'etre for the continued employment of said counter-terrorism experts, think tanks, and writers.

What was Bin Laden/Al Qaeda's gameplan?,MichaelEmouse,https://www.reddit.com/r/WarCollege/comments/13q3sh1/what_was_bin_ladenal_qaedas_gameplan/,2regin,"This is correct. Egyptian Journalist Abdel Bari Atwan, who interviewed Bin Laden in 1996 and obtained a copy of the organization’s plan wrote The Secret History of Al Qaeda in 2005, where he summarized the organizations plans as follows:

Al Qaeda would launch an attack against the U.S., causing it to invade a Muslim country, then form decentralized “franchises” internationally who will continue attacking and provoke further intervention. By the year 2020, the U.S., exhausted by intervention, will experience an economic collapse that will trigger a global economic meltdown. That meltdown would destabilize middle eastern governments and adjust the balance of power between Muslim and non-Muslim countries, allowing the formation of an Islamic Caliphate. Atwan deemed the plan “unrealistic”, but it basically all ended up happening except the last part: the economic meltdown was delayed by heavy quantitative easing during the pandemic and is still looming.

That same year, a Jordanian journalist who was Al-Zarqawi’s cellmate summarized Al Qaeda’s plan as:

2001-2003: Attack America and incite invasions.

2003-2006: Build resistance in Iraq.

2007-2010: Expand to Syria.

2013-2016: Declare Caliphate (!)

2017-2020: “Final confrontation” and victory.

It should be noted Al-Zarqawi was a local figure commanding only Al Qaeda in Iraq and Syria, so his plan was more local. On that note, the decentralization of the organization meant every regional leader likely had a different plan than HQ’s overarching “2020 strategy”.

AQI’s plan specifically derailed in 2013, where, just as the now deceased Zarqawi had ordered, his followers proclaimed a Caliphate. Things proceeded swimmingly at first as they ejected the Iraqi army from Northern Iraq, but they then sought to forcibly integrate Al Qaeda’s Syrian affiliate, the Al-Nusra Front, leading to a schism with Al Qaeda headquarters. Worse, the international community found the Caliphate’s antics distasteful enough to form an unlikely coalition that crushed them.",8

I do wonder on what basis that this was determined to be Bin Laden's strategy? Did he write about it or did he make speeches saying this to be the case? Steve Coll might have been correct for everything else in terms of the history between Bin Laden and the US, from the US's perspective, because Coll had access to US sources. However, I seriously doubt any assessment of Bin Laden or ""global terrorism"" strategy that espouse something similar to the quoted part. This narrative appeared to have been especially popular in the counter-terrorism think tanks and milieu that made some talk about this grand vision of terrorism which coincidentally, I'm sure, justifies their existence.

However, we do have sources on the other side: Bin Laden told us why he did it. The Guardian published his ""[letter to America](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/nov/24/theobserver)"". He wrote it down.

>(e) Your forces occupy our countries; you spread your military bases throughout them; you corrupt our lands, and you besiege our sanctities, to protect the security of the Jews and to ensure the continuity of your pillage of our treasures.  
>  
>(f) You have starved the Muslims of Iraq, where children die every day. It is a wonder that more than 1.5 million Iraqi children have died as a result of your sanctions, and you did not show concern. Yet when 3000 of your people died, the entire world rises and has not yet sat down.  
>  
>(g) You have supported the Jews in their idea that Jerusalem is their eternal capital, and agreed to move your embassy there. With your help and under your protection, the Israelis are planning to destroy the Al-Aqsa mosque. Under the protection of your weapons, Sharon entered the Al-Aqsa mosque, to pollute it as a preparation to capture and destroy it.

""We"" and ""Us"" here should be interpreted as ""Muslims"".

As for what he wanted:

>(Q2) As for the second question that we want to answer: What are we calling you to, and what do we want from you?  
>  
>(1) The first thing that we are calling you to is Islam.

Read ""convert to Islam"". Attacking someone to make them submit to Islam is consistent with the Islamic doctrine established during the time of the Prophet and the first four rightly-guided Caliphs. Muslims supposedly make the infidels convert to Islam by attacking them until they surrender and relent. Explaining 9/11 this way is both consistent with the Islamic doctrine and primary source on Bin Laden's strategy.

>(4) We also advise you to stop supporting Israel, and to end your support of the Indians in Kashmir, the Russians against the Chechens and to also cease supporting the Manila Government against the Muslims in Southern Philippines.  
>  
>(5) We also advise you to pack your luggage and get out of our lands. We desire for your goodness, guidance, and righteousness, so do not force us to send you back as cargo in coffins.  
>  
>(6) Sixthly, we call upon you to end your support of the corrupt leaders in our countries. Do not interfere in our politics and method of education. Leave us alone, or else expect us in New York and Washington.

""Leave"". This is, of course, opposite to the claim that he wanted to draw the US into a protracted war in Afghanistan, as a planning goal for 9/11.",17

The lesson he learned from Afghanistan was that you only need to bleed a superpower to the point they capitulate.  Bin Laden said as much in his 1998 interview on ABC going so far as to directly connect the Soviet defeat in Afghanistan to the collapse of the USSR itself.  He had the same goal in mind for the US and knew that terrorism would be the key to provoking into multiple wars meant to bleed us financially and turn American public opinion against its own government.  To that end, the Letter to America is meant for two audiences: the American public and Muslims worldwide.  I believe that he intentionally downplays the strategy of defeating America as it supports his call to Islam; making him seem somewhat reasonable to Americans and representing a purity of Islamic belief to Muslims worldwide.  He knows his demand that the US abandon Israel, all the regimes in the Middle East, and go home isn’t a possibility but it gives him credibility and allows him to ram the point home that our presence in the region is an occupation.  Us leaving was his goal but in his view, the path to that was in bankrupting another superpower and to do that, he needed to entangle us in wars meant to bleed us dry.",28

Attacking Paris was a means to take the fight to the enemy and support the legitimacy of the Caliphate.  Much like AQ, ISIS ideology in practice meandered as the organization came under pressure militarily.

I certainly don't. The guy was a liar and a schemer. All I take away from this letter to America is an airing of grievances, and the bog-standard sentiment of ""convert to Islam, at the point of a sword if necessary.""

As far as the evidence for his ""strategy"" to draw the US into an unwinnable war...well it's from his own mouth. He made a video in 2004, which he gave to Al-Jazeera.

Here is the transcript from it:

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2004/11/1/full-transcript-of-bin-ladins-speech

So now we have two conflicting narratives from the same guy. He's ideologically inconsistent, and the only real through-lines to his entire life's story is a deep hatred of the United States and a very radical interpretation of Islam.",16
What was Bin Laden/Al Qaeda's gameplan?,MichaelEmouse,https://www.reddit.com/r/WarCollege/comments/13q3sh1/what_was_bin_ladenal_qaedas_gameplan/,DasKapitalist,">Leave"". This is, of course, opposite to the claim that he wanted to draw the US into a protracted war in Afghanistan, as a planning goal for 9/11.



Given the Quran's instruction to convert people by force, when someone tells you they're a holy warrior setting up an OG caliphate...assuming they just want everyone else to ""leave"" is rather shortsighted.  Particularly given the geopolitical implications of him explicitly stating his plan to:


1)  Overthrow most or all of the governments in the Middle East, since the House of Saud et al arent exactly going to be thrilled at being replaced with a caliphate.


2)  Do something about Westerners allegedly ripping off the Middle East's oil wealth.  Can you say ""Embargo"" three times fast?


3)  Genocide the Jews, particularly in Israel.  Because murdering a couple million people with an outsized level of influence and visibility in global politics and media will in no way escalate to a massive multi-way war.


4)  Dismantle vast parts of the American empire around the world.  Which the military industrial complex would nod and go along with, of course.


Overall that ""leave"" sounds a whole lot more like ""Start a region-wide insurgency where he kicks every hornet's nest he can think of in an effort to exhaust the proverbial little dutch boy trying to plug 50 holes at once"".  That Afghanistan was the most *successful* leak isnt surprising given its reputation as the graveyard of empires...but he was clearly shotgunning that approach all over the place.",2
What was Bin Laden/Al Qaeda's gameplan?,MichaelEmouse,https://www.reddit.com/r/WarCollege/comments/13q3sh1/what_was_bin_ladenal_qaedas_gameplan/,SmirkingImperialist,">He had the same goal in mind for the US and knew that terrorism would be the key to provoking into multiple wars meant to bleed us financially and turn American public opinion against its own government.

I couldn't find anything that will directly support this point. That it was a rational decision to conduct 9/11 in the specific hope that the US would arrive in Afghanistan and he would fight a protracted insurgency there. Yes, he mentioned it in a 2004 video but as I responded [elsewhere](https://www.reddit.com/r/WarCollege/comments/13q3sh1/comment/jldkyja/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), it might as well be post-facto rationalisation when his side was *losing*.

>He knows his demand that the US abandon Israel, all the regimes in the Middle East, and go home isn’t a possibility but it gives him credibility and allows him to ram the point home that our presence in the region is an occupation. Us leaving was his goal but in his view, the path to that was in bankrupting another superpower and to do that, he needed to entangle us in wars meant to bleed us dry.  
>  
>It’s certainly possible but if you take into account his previous statements in the media, his fatwas of 1996 and 1998, and AQ’s actions in the 90s (Somalia, Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Kenya, etc..), I think it’s more clear that his goal wasn’t for us to just go home.

It would be just as consistent for him to think that ""OK, so we attacked the Americans; mostly American troops and government officials, in these countries and it didn't work. We need to attack them in their own countries and go straight for the heart of America for them to take the message"". Thus, the planes flown into the buildings. This is a theologically consistent approach and a proximal, linear, and rational thinking: we need to ratchet up the pressure.

Then to say that it would be to draw the US into an protracted insurgency contradicts the reality on the ground that the Taliban and AQ did not initially fight *as insurgents*. Operation Anaconda, for example, were [surprisingly conventional battles](https://press.armywarcollege.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1808&context=monographs).

>The defense debate tends to treat Afghanistan as either a revolution or a fluke: either the “Afghan Model” of special operations forces (SOF) plus precision munitions plus an indigenous ally is a widely applicable template for American defense planning, or it is a nonreplicable product of local idiosyncrasies. In fact, it is neither. The Afghan campaign of last fall and winter was actually much closer to a typical 20th century mid-intensity conflict, albeit one with unusually heavy fire support for one side. And this view has very different implications than either proponents or skeptics of the Afghan Model now claim.

They fought, as they did against the Soviets, as fairly good light infantry defenders. May be that was the intention of Bin Laden, but even so, I will protest the notion that it was intended to be an insurgency. The classical image of insurgency anyway, but then Stephen Biddle, in a recent book, questioned the stereotypical characterisation of insurgents vs. conventional forces.",14
What was Bin Laden/Al Qaeda's gameplan?,MichaelEmouse,https://www.reddit.com/r/WarCollege/comments/13q3sh1/what_was_bin_ladenal_qaedas_gameplan/,SmirkingImperialist,"I took notice that the Al-Jazeera video was in 2004, when his, AQ's and the Taliban's fortunes were much worse than in 2002, which was when his letter was published. It might have very well been a post-facto ""it was my plan all along"" justification and a message to other Islamists that ""don't look at the current poor fortunes. They can't win, they won't win"". A ""Kiev was a feint"" sort of revisionism to make one think that he was a 4D chess master or something. ""We are on the right side of history"". We may very well never know what was the *actual* strategic vision when 9/11 was being planned; as in during 1999, 2000, and 2001.

Bin Laden's ideology and appeal is not inconsistent. His image and expression is that of someone who is fluent in classical Arabic; the Arabic ""of the book"". ""convert to Islam, at the point of a sword if necessary."" should be a valid strategy for him and for the Islamists, crazy or objectionable to Westerners as it might, but it is both theologically consistent and part of an earlier primary source.

>a very radical interpretation of Islam.

To a point, Bin Laden was not practicing a very radical interpretation of Islam. He is less radical than the Sunni extremists who would later characterise the violence there or ISIS. Bin Laden's point was that despite theological differences within Islam, Muslims shouldn't kill one another. The Iraqi Sunni extremists went stupidly crazy and went after the Shias. It was part of Islam to divide the world into the [House of Islam and the House of War](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/islam-rsquo-s-house-of-islam-and-house-of-war):

>The world is divided into the House of Islam and the House of War, the Dar al-Islam and the Dar al-harb. The Dar al-Islam is all those lands in which a Muslim government rules and the Holy Law of Islam prevails. Non-Muslims may live there on Muslim sufferance. The outside world, which has not yet been subjugated, is called the ""House of War,"" and strictly speaking a perpetual state of jihad, of holy war, is imposed by the law. The law also provided that the jihad might be interrupted by truces as and when appropriate. In fact, the periods of peace and war were not vastly different from those which existed between the Christian states of Europe for most of European history.  
  
The law thus divides unbelievers theologically into those who have a book and profess what Islam recognizes as a divine religion and those who do not; politically into dhimmis, those who have accepted the supremacy of the Muslim state and the primacy of the Muslims, and harbis, the denizens of the Dar al-harb, the House of War, who remain outside the Islamic frontier, and with whom therefore there is in principle, a canonically obligatory perpetual state of war until the whole world is either converted or subjugated.",11

Regarding his view that America was a paper tiger (like the USSR and would suffer the same fate), he keys on our actions in Somalia. 

“…you moved…twenty eight thousand American soldiers into Somalia. However, when tens of your soldiers were killed in minor battles and one American pilot was dragged in the streets…you left the area… You have been disgraced by Allah and…the extent of your impotence and weakness became very clear.”

He felt that we could be defeated by entangling us in small wars much like what happened in Somalia. 
He continues to describe the manner in which AQ will fight America. 

“…it must be obvious to you that, due to the imbalance of power between our armed forces and the enemy forces, a suitable means of fighting must be adopted… In other words to initiate a guerrilla war… It is wise…for the armed military forces not to be engaged in a conventional fight with the forces of the crusader enemy.”

He clearly believes that fighting a guerrilla war, or an insurgency, of the people against the U.S. was a key component of his strategy and that required the US to be engaged in war in the region.",7

Wait out the clock until the West gets tired of supplying Ukraine, then use their larger population, industrial base, and stores of materiel to grind down the Ukrainians until the front collapses. 

>What do they want the world to look like if they prevail?

They want a reborn Russian Empire. They want a world without NATO or the EU or the US so there’s no one to check their ambitions. They want a world divided into spheres of influence where each of the great imperial powers can do whatever they want.

Basically, they want a throwback to imperialism pre-WWI.

>How will it improve the lives of Russians in material ways?

Little. Maybe there’d be some marginal increase in wealth for the average Russian from colonial exploitation, but I expect most of that would be sucked up by the oligarchs and their ilk.

Otherwise, this is just a salve for national pride. Russians get the empire they feel they deserve and make their neighbors afraid of them again (which is considered a good thing).

>How will it improve the world?

It won’t. It’ll make the world at large worse. Putin doesn’t give a damn about the world, only Russia.",6

Just out of curiosity, how exactly would the ""Axis powers"" gather troops there in order stage an attack?  There are exactly two continents within range of New Zealand.  One is Antarctica and the other is Australia.  Antarctica isn't exactly somewhere where you could mass forces to stage an attack (how would you get them there unnoticed?) and if Australia is lost then the shit has really hit the fan considering the number of nations that would have to fall before Australia could be invaded (e.g. Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, Philippines, Vietnam, Indonesia, etc).

1) Consequences.  Is there any evidence that Trump thinks those are a thing that can ever happen to him.  I've seen plenty of signs that he believes he can do whatever he wants and be perfectly consequence free.  And as such, what kind of hold can blackmail have over him if he'll just assume that he can skate away from any consequences over it being revealed.

2) Narcissism.  Does Trump care about anyone other than himself enough to put anyone else's goals over his own?  I doubt it, and as such, he would still make a terrible puppet, since what his 'master' wants would always be shuffled behind whatever it is he wants.

And finally 3) Fickleness.  Dude is inconsistent as all hell.  Even if you can aim him at a target, odds are he'll be diverted away from it before he can finish the job.  Read any of the stories of his first term.  Guy could get stuck on certain things, but often he was more like a weathervane, pointing in the direction of the last person to suggest something to him and letting his passion be guided by whatever the latest stimulus was.

Guy makes a terrible puppet for many of the same reasons that he makes a terrible president, and I've never seen a convincing argument against that.",1

But let’s say the countries north of Australia lost to China. They’d just go through Indonesia and take over their coast and then sail east when they’re ready.

Of course not. Trump is bound by one thing: **power**. *This* is what Putin promised him, this is what Putin got him with the propaganda machine.

And as of Jan 20th, 2025, Trump will have all the power there is to have. At least, *from Putin*.

See, Putin is an honest thief. As in, he adheres to the thief code: he lies and steals from *everyone else*, but between thieves, there is only honesty.

It's part of the Russian prison code, **the Thief Law**^1. The punishment for breaking it is death. Russia is thought of as a mafia state, but it's not even that - it's an overgrown prison hierarchy.

Putin **counts** on the Thief Law. There's blackmail, of course, but the power he sells to other Theives (like Orban or Schraeder) comes with an **expectation of later payment** in loyalty. 

To my gleeful joy, he seemed to expect the same of Trump... as the realization, very slowly, is setting in now. 

**Quote**^2 :

>“To achieve success in the election, **Donald Trump relied on certain forces** to which he has corresponding *obligations*,” Patrushev told the business daily Kommersant in response to a question about whether the outcome of the presidential election would bode well for Russia. **“As a responsible person, he will be obliged to fulfill them.”**

**AHHAHAHAHHHAHAHAHHA**.

Or homeboy Poo Tin is about to find out just how good Trump is with paying his bills and following honor codes.

The argument is easily made that their acts are more destructive than the single bombing run it would take to declare an act of war.

They breached major telecoms, the full extent and had access for who knows how long.

""*Oh it's routine..*""

They used that access to create their own hidden backdoors into the federal government's own mandatory backdoor. They could have made hundreds or thousands of their own routes into it. The same back doors the NSA and FBI use, they now have access to.

""*Meh, loss of life is where we draw the line*""

So that means they can pretty much breach anything and everything, including financial systems and nuclear systems... but without killing a single person yet; you won't consider it on the same scale as a loss of life.

They breached major telecoms, the full extent and had access for who knows how long.

They used that access to create their own hidden backdoors into the federal government's own mandatory backdoor. They could have made hundreds or thousands of their own routes into it. The same back doors the NSA and FBI use, they now have access to.

Russia at least has (had) people with combat experience and a much larger amount of equipment. China has 0 combat experience and has nowhere near the amount of equipment to arm enough people to even defend itself from an invasion. It relies on defense through terrain.

And just because it has a big navy doesn't mean it can support a large naval invasion. The larger your fleet, the larger your support and supply line is. 

Do you get it now?

According to your ""logic"", Taiwan would have been a done deal for China on a weekend. The reason it isn't is because invasions are fucking hard. Especially for militaries without experience. Maintaining and supplying a large army is pure hell.

On ne peut pas focaliser un problème à la fois. Tu dois tout prendre de front. Si tu retires le budget de la défense, tu devras réinvestir beaucoup plus plus tard (si tu le peux encore) car tu auras laissé pourrir tes intérêts internationaux. Ou tu devras te retirer et laisser la place à d’autres (Chine, US) sans ne plus jamais pouvoir prendre position.

Pour le coup, le Mali est loin d’être un gouffre comme l’Irak ou l’Afghanistan. L’Afrique est en proie à des luttes d’influence de la part des super puissances et la France arrive à avoir des intérêts convergeant avec les nations en place (stabilité politique et économique), ce qui n’est pas le cas de tout le monde (la Chine en a rien à foutre de la stabilité dans la région, tant qu’elle a ce qu’elle veut).

Homme de paille très malhonnête et sophisme de la pente glissante. Il existe un cadre juridique à la guerre qui empêche de torturer des combattants ennemis et il est respecté. Tuer des ennemis c'est complètement conforme à ce Droit et, à mon avis, moral dans le cadre d'une guerre.

Encore une fois je le répète : ce n’est pas parce que la loi le dit, que le règlement de la guerre (respecté à demi) le dit ou que je ne sais quelle accord le promulgue, que c’est éthique ou moral.

Les talibans ne font pas partie d'Al-Qaeda, qui est en fait plus ancien que les talibans. Al-Qaeda a été fondée dans les années 80 lors de la guerre en Afghanistan, alors que la résistance afghane à l'occupation russe était menée par plusieurs partis politico-paramilitaires, comme Jamaat-e Islami, Hizb-e Islami, Mahaz-e Mili, etc. Il y en avait 7 majoritaires, les ""Sept de Peshawar"" du nom de la ville pakistanaise où ils avaient leurs bases arrière. 

Al-Qaeda n'en faisait pas partie, à l'époque ce n'était qu'un bureau de logistique créé pour faciliter l'entrée de combattants internationaux en Afghanistan appelé le MAK (Maktab-e Kidhamat).

En 1992, quand l'alliance entre les partis afghans s'est effondrée, et que la guerre civile a pris tout le pays, les talibans ont émergé des écoles islamiques de la mouvance Deobandi, qui avaient beaucoup de succès dans les camps de réfugiés afghans au Pakistan, et ont envahi l'Afghanistan avec le soutien des services secrets pakistanais. Certains partis politiques afghans s'y sont alliés, d'autres ont combattu (comme Jamaat-e Islami). Ben Laden a vu le potentiel des talibans et s'est allié à eux. Il était surtout attirant de par la grande fortune de la famille Ben Laden qui détient un gros conglomérat d'industries (le Saudi Ben Laden Group).

Les Talibans n'ont jamais voulu frapper hors d'Afghanistan, ils s'en foutent. Leur intérêt, c'est l'Emirat islamique d'Afghanistan, mais ils n'allaient pas empêcher Al-Qaeda de frapper les infidèles non plus... Et le coup de maître du 11 septembre a conféré un énorme prestique à Ben Laden, tant et si bien que la ""marque"" Al-Qaeda est reprise par plusieurs groupes qui veulent bénéficier de l'expertise, du réseau et du prestige que confère l'organisation. Tu as principalement Al-Qaeda au Maghreb Islamique, Al-Qaeda dans la Péninsule Arabique (Yémen) et Al-Qaeda au Pays des Deux Rivières (Irak). Daesh a gagné le même prestige avec leurs gains territoriaux en Syrie, et ironiquement des jihadistes afghans désabusés se sont rebellés contre Al-Qaeda et les Talibans en fondant leur branche de Daesh en Afghanistan (Dénommée l'ISKP) qui combat les deux groupes là-bas.",33

C'est d'ailleurs avec lui que se faisait les négociations sur l'échange de prisonniers et sur le cessez-le-feu.

Mais Bibi ne veut pas de négociations. Il ne veut pas d'un mec avec qui on peut discuter en face. Il veut le résistant le plus haineux et le plus radicalisé pour pouvoir dérouler son discours et continuer d'écraser les palestiniens avec l'aval de l'Occident.",-8

De quel fanatisme tu parles? Fanatisme religieux? Fanatisme anti-israël? Et de quelle base? Avant la création d'Israël ou après, une fois que des gens ont été tués, dépossédés de leurs terres? Les décennies qui ont suivi sur le même modèle? Le gel de la situation politique depuis 20/25 ans qui a favorisé la colonisation... ?

Les pays limitrophes musulmans sont tout d'abord débordés de réfugiés. Ce sont généralement de petits pays peu développés qui ont vu leur population grossir de 20% d'un coup parfois, avec des gens qui attendent de bénéficier du droit au retour depuis des dizaines d'années. Être entassé dans des camps pendant des décennies, ça pousse aussi au fanatisme.

Chacun a ses raisons de ne pas vouloir de réfugiés: l’Égypte voit encore dans le Hamas des soutiens aux Frères musulmans, le Liban est à bout de souffle, la Jordanie souhaite se stabiliser, se développer et maintenir des bonnes relations avec tout le monde (alors que leur pays a déjà servi d'arrière base au terrorisme palestinien)...

Plus largement, il y a un énorme soutien à la cause palestinienne chez les populations musulmanes.

Et il existait bel et bien une opposition au Hamas à Gaza, peut-être pas des structures organisées, mais des voix et des gens plus modérés. Aujourd'hui je pense pas qu'il en reste beaucoup, au grand minimum, la guerre les pousse à se taire. Un peu comme les actions de Trump contre l'Iran ont fini par faire terriblement mal aux modérés, et les ont poussés à se ranger à de nombreuses reprises derrière l'aile dure.

Dire que les palestiniens sont des fanatiques *à la base... A la base, l*e Sham est une région beaucoup plus ouverte que le Najd ou le Pakistan. C'est difficile de faire la politique fiction et de se demander si la Palestine aurait viré vers l'islamisme sans la création d'Israël et ce qui s'en est suivi, mais à la base ils sont pas beaucoup plus fanatiques que leurs voisins.

Vers l'infini et au-delà.

L'histoire nous montre qu'il n'y a que 2 façons de s'en sortir: soit en mettant fin à la colonisation, soit en procédant à un nettoyage ethnique (ou pire), on conviendra que c'est tout sauf une solution, même si elle est envisagée par l'extrême droite Israélienne (au pouvoir) et le Hamas (qui n'en a pas la possibilité).

Mais pour arrêter la colonisation, il faudrait d'abord la reconnaitre; tant qu'Israël ne le fera pas, il y aura toujours une organisation en face (ligue Arabe, OLP, Hamas ou quelque soit son futur nom) pour commettre des crimes atroces, auquel Israël répondra en commettant d'autres crimes, atroces aussi. Ce cercle est vraiment vicieux.

Ce ping-pong macabre dure depuis 76 ans, voire plus si l'on compte les exactions commises des 2 côtés pendant le mandat britannique. La Cour Pénale Internationale distribue les cartons rouges sangs (crimes contre l'humanité), mais tout le monde s'en fout, c'est très surprenant en France, patrie des droits de l'homme, sûrement capable de prendre un peu de recul.

Alors que le niveau de violence atteint des sommets, et que les risques d'escalades pourraient embraser la région, je garde l'espoir qu'Israël finisse par se rappeler qu'ils ont la clef pour résoudre ce trop long conflit. Il en va de la survie d'Israel et des Palestiniens maintenant. Et notre responsabilité en tant qu'Européens est immense : la Shoah c'est nous, pas les arabes. La Colonisation, c'est nous, pas les arabes.

Yitzhak Rabin avait presque réussi et il avait tout compris: ""*Je combattrai le terrorisme comme s'il n'y avait pas de processus de paix, mais je poursuivrai le processus de paix comme s'il n'y avait pas de terrorisme.""*. La paix pleure encore ce grand homme assassiné par l'extrême droite. Il n'y aura pas de paix sans compréhension historique de la situation : la colonisation en Cisjordanie et le blocus de Gaza.

J'ai jamais dit que c'était des démocrates et que leurs méthodes étaient idéales, c'est un parti politique qui fait aussi dans la lutte armée et qui s'est formé dans une prison à ciel ouvert où chaque leader qui commence à émerger se fait assassiner par les geoliers, et qui se fait bombarder par ces geoliers toutes les quelques années en qualifiant ça en public de ""tondre la pelouse"".

Tous les leaders qui font autrement se font assassiner par les sionistes, comment pourrait-il en être autrement ? L'entité sioniste a choisit cet adversaire en assassinant tous les autres.

Maintenant on peut tout à fait déplorer leurs methodes, et espérer qu'ils n'arrivent jamais au pouvoir une fois une paix établie car c'est un parti extrémiste et violent, mais reconnaitre que leur objectif c'est la libération de la Palestine et qu'ils se battent pied à pied contre l'entité sioniste depuis le 7 octobre à Gaza, ce qui les place objectivement dans une position de défenseur face à la destruction généralisée qu'a entrepris le colonisateur.

Est-ce que leur méthode est efficace et la meilleure à leur disposition ? Très contestable. Mais note quand même que toutes les autres méthodes jusque là ont échoué. La dernière approche pacifique c'était la marche du retour des gazaouis qui ont manifesté pacifiquement devant les barrières qui encerclent Gaza et les sionistes les ont massacré sans raison, visant des enfants, des soignants, des manifestants pacifiste.

Et le Hamas a gagné en succès sur la base suivant : les accords signé entre Israel et la Palestine (du temps de l'OLP) ont été baffoué par les Israelien, qui ont continué la colonisation. Le Hamas a eu du succès (il est pas la plus grosse force politique pour rien dans le coin), et Israel utilise l'existence du Hamas pour justifier l'accélération de la colonisation et un plan d'épuration ethnique a peine déguisé (et les Européens disent : ""Mais l'AP [le Fatah] sont plus gentils donc ils crèvent moins, ils acceptent de quitter leur maison sans rien dire jour après jour""). 

Tu sais on vivait un peu moins bien la ou il y avait des résistants en France. Et les Algériens vivaient moins bien ou il y avait le FLN. Et c'est fou en 2024 on en est encore a dire qu'ils ont raison de se laisser faire, car refuser le colonialisme c'est mal. Je plains les Tibétiens et les Ouighour le jour ou ils voudront l'indépendance, on passera vite de ""free Tibet"" à ""soutien au peuple Chinois"" je crois.

>Dis moi que tu n'as jamais parlé à un palestinien, sans me dire que tu n'as jamais parlé à un palestinien. Le Hamas ne vise pas ça, les palestiniens ne visent pas ça, la diplomacie palestinienne ne vise pas ça. Par contre les médias qui ne relaient que le point de vue sioniste racontent ça oui.

il y a l'option classique d'une interception en amont. ce qui aurait permis d'installer des charges explosives dans les appareils, mais c'est un cas de figure exotique, en général ce genre d'interception c'est pour installer des mouchards, des portes dérobées, etc. pour faire de la surveillance et de l'intrusion informatique.  
mais une fois la charge mise en place un déclenchement à distance en envoyant un signal simultanément est facile.

l'autre option sans modification physique des appareils repose sur le seul composant ""explosif"" dans ce genre d'appareil, c'est à dire la batterie. il faudrait savoir de quel type d'appareil il s'agit, parce que la possibilité de pouvoir déclencher une explosion simultanée de batteries à distance est pas évidente et ça suppose une conception de la circuiterie électronique de mauvaise qualité parce que ça ne devrait pas être possible matériellement avec un circuit bien conçu.

la partie piratage est aussi intéréssante, mais probablement plus classique. Ainsi que la partie renseignement, mais là aussi certainement assez classique au vu des moyens de l'état d'Israel.

-edit-

on a eu la réponse: le hezbollah a passé commande de pagers d'une nouvelle marque qu'ils n'avaient pas encore utilisée, le mossad a intercepté les appareils et installé dedans une charge de 20gr d'explosif PETN sur la batterie dont la détonation est déclenchée à distance par la surchauffe de la batterie.

Je ne juge pas de savoir si c'est vrai ou pas, simplement je me demande si ces Américains qui célèbrent ces attaques se rendent compte qu'utiliser des moyens aussi sales (buter quelqu'un qui fait ses courses avec une mini bombe) n'améliore pas franchement l'image d'Israël en dehors des pays occidentaux et encore moins des US qui laissent passer.

Je vois pas trop en quoi placer des bombes pour tuer des gens de manière extra judiciaire dans un autre pays sans tenir compte d'éventuelles morts collatérales est très différent du terrorisme.

Une démocratie devrait être plus exemplaire et ne pas s'abaisser à ce niveau, mais je vais probablement recevoir quelques downvotes pour ça, j'assume de pas être à l'aise, libre aux autres de trouver ça moral de ""buter les terroristes jusque dans les chiottes"". Faudra juste pas faire un cours de moral par la suite.

PS: les downvotes à gogo dans les espaces commentaires sentent quand même pas mal le brigading sur r/France. Qu'il y ait des pro Israël contents de voir des attaques à la bombe contre le Hezbollah, je veux bien le croire, mais aussi nombreux j'en doute. De toutes façons c'est inutile, a part dans les pays occidentaux, l'image d'Israël et ses actions est malheureusement dégueulasse (alors que ce pays c'est plus que son gouvernement et son armée). Tout le brigading possible n'y changera rien. Et le pays peut continuer d'envahir et bombarder tous ses voisins pendant les 100 prochaines années, cette stratégie est vouée à l'échec. Si le Liban est dans cet état et le Hezbollah si puissant, c'est justement parce qu'Israel a choisi la manière forte dans le passé (expulsion des Palestiniens vers le Liban, implication dans la guerre civile, intervention militaire, occupation du sud etc..). La manière forte ne réglera rien et ne fera qu'envenimer la situation. C'est presque triste (voire tragique quand on aime le pays) de voir les défenseurs d'Israël ne pas le comprendre.",-1

Je vais faire trois hypothèses qui sont loin d'être farfelues :

* Les pagers ne disposent pas de BMS capables de réagir à temps à la sortie des conditions opérationnelles appropriées des batteries embarquées.
* Les pagers ne disposent pas d'évents correctement dimensionnés aux batteries embarquées.
* Les pagers ont une faille de sécurité permettant à un attaquant de les faire tomber dans un état qui va mener à la fonte des batteries.

Pour mémoire, le principe d'une grenade c'est qu'on libère beaucoup d'énergie très rapidement sans qu'elle ait nulle part où aller à part à faire céder les parois de son contenant et envoyer des morceaux solides dans toutes les directions, qui iront blesser ou tuer les personnes autour.

Une batterie au lithium va libérer une grosse quantité d'énergie rapidement dans un certain nombre de conditions (de température, d'intensité du courant tiré, de court-circuit, etc...). Ce qui nous permet d'éviter ceci ce sont d'une part les BMS (qui ont pour boulot de s'assurer qu'elles opèrent dans des conditions appropriée) et les évents du dispositif électronique qui nécessite la batterie.

S'agissant de pagers, on peut tirer deux conclusions utiles :

* Ils seront généralement placés dans une poche contre le corps de la personne visée elle-même, l'explosion n'aura pas à être puissante pour faire des dégâts avec peu de risques de victimes collatérales.
* Ils seront susceptibles de recevoir le message malveillant déclenchant l'explosion (c'est le principe même d'un pager).

Je pense qu'il est tout à fait possible pour les services secrets Israéliens d'exploiter un bug dans le firmware d'un pager mal conçu pour l'amener à tirer plus d'ampères que sa batterie ne peut en fournir, la menant jusqu'à à la fonte puis à une explosion de faible intensité néanmoins capable de blesser quelqu'un en touchant un organe ou une artère et éventuellement causer la mort.",-5

J'entends par cela le simple envoi d'une instruction piégée via une faille de sécurité pour outrepasser la sécurité thermique de l'appareil sans rien changer d'autre, j'ai des doutes. C'était le mode opératoire de Stuxnet via l'opération ""Olympic Games"" (si mes souvenirs sont bons), les centrifugeuses étaient infectées par un ver sur une clé USB et ce ver, via une ou deux failles de sécu inconnues, tapaient les scada des dites centrifugeuses.

Résultat les centrifugeuses centrifugeaient bien au-delà de leurs limites et finissaient par casser, les dispositifs d'enrichissement étant organisés en cascade, cela posait des soucis pour l'enrichissement de l'uranium. Je crois également que des morceaux de rock étaient diffusés aléatoirement pour rendre dingues le personnel de Natanz.

Mais au-delà de ça, les batteries auraient brûlé pas forcément explosé.

Par contre, intercepter des lots de pagers dont la marque et le modèle sont prisés, les modifier en y mettant 10gr d'un explosif à haut rendement, soit sur site (pas discret mais cela permet d'éviter que le matériel piégé ne soit affecté à une personne qui n'a rien à voir), en avance de phase (interception du lot sain et changement par un lot déjà piégé), ça, c'est tout à fait possible.

Dans le doco [Zero days](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_Days), des journalistes expliquent que les US etaient pas vraiment contents sur l'utilisation tres aggressive de Stuxnet. 

Finalement, ils ont fait peter des centrifuges mais les Iraniens les ont remplace assez vite. Les americains voulaient une approche plus subtile pour un control sur la longeur.

Le seul facteur qui a eu un impacte durable sur le nombre de centrifuges iraniennes a ete **l'accord diplomatique**. 

Pareil pour l'assassinat de Haniyeh. Il a ete remplace par celui qui a orquestre l'attentat de 7 nov. Un accord entre les deux camps semble bien impossible.

Du coup, si l'attaque a visé des cibles légitimes mais n'a fait aucun effort pour limiter les pertes civiles ou en a touché de manière disproportionnée, c'est un crime de guerre.

L'explosif utilisé est de type militaire (par opposition aux matériaux détournés comme ceux qui ont provoqué la destruction d'AZF ou du port de Beyrouth), très dense en énergie ce qui provoque une détonation (propagation à vitesse supersonique contre subsonique pour une déflagration).

Sur mes opinions politiques c'est pas très compliqué. Les militaires du Hezbollah sont des terroristes, ils sont classés comme tel, et à ceux qui pensent qu'ils savent mieux que nos organes démocratiques si eux ou le Hamas sont terroristes faut peut-être se remettre en question, ces classements sont liés aux données que des services de renseignements ont (en plus de tout ce qui est public), parce qu'ils savent que ces groupes ciblent civils et militaires indifféremment. Le fait qu'ils soient terroristes font qu'ils sont une cible légitime, à partir du moment où ils sont ciblés militairement, l'attaque est légitime. En pratique il faut que le ciblage soit ""proportionné"" entre le nombre de combattants touchés et les potentiels dommages collatéraux, dans ce cas çi rien n'indique par rapport à l'usage habituels des armes que ce ciblage était disproportionné. Mais cet usage habituel des armes n'a rien de ""proportionné"" quand on n'a pas l'habitude.

C'était une guerre contre des terroristes, cela excusait donc le recours aux bombardements massifs, mais également aux assassinats, à l'utilisation de services secrets pour frapper même dans des espaces civils. On ""tuera les terroristes jusque dans les chiottes"". Je me demandais à l'époque comment les Russes pouvaient laisser passer ça, maintenant je comprends en voyant les réactions à cette nouvelle. La fin justifie les moyens et les démocraties peuvent désormais plastiquer et poser des bombes dans un pays et ça passe tant que ça vise un mouvement terroriste.

Au passage la guerre n'est pas une carte d'immunité qui permet des ""dommages collatéraux"" ou d'utiliser tous les moyens. La guerre (et il faudrait définir car là c'est un conflit entre un État et un groupe) a encore quelques règles et on est justement indigné quand Poutine bombarde à outrance des villes ukrainiennes, quand les troupes américaines causent de trop nombreuses pertes civiles en Irak dans des bombardements, quand Hussein ou Assad font gazer des populations qu'ils présentent comme terroristes... Donc non, une guerre ce n'est pas simplement ""éliminer des combattants quelque soit les moyens et malgré quelques dégâts collatéraux"" sinon on utiliserait toujours le gaz moutarde sur les champs de bataille et le Vietnam n'aurait pas fait scandale.

Les ""dégâts collatéraux"" ce sont des vies humaines, c'est un pays, le Liban, avec lequel Israël n'est pas en guerre et n'a pas plus le droit de mener de telles opérations que le Hezbollah n'a le droit de lancer des roquettes. Et ce sont des méthodes de barbouzes et de tueurs, dignes du FSB qui bute les opposants de Poutine en Europe, pas d'une démocratie.

On peut utiliser de telles moyens mais on a pas intérêt à me demander de m'indigner le jour où l'Iran placera des bombes en Israel, butera une centaine de membres de Tsahal en permission à Tel Aviv et en blessera 3000 (dont quelques dommages collatéraux de moins de 10 ans).",1

- Ils représentent l'Occident attaqué par le Sud 
- La shoah est une faute historique de l'Europe et le soutient à Israel un moyen de rectifier le mal fait.

Obviously some of those would have been in bad faith, but it would be interesting to see how many of the 7,000 banned subreddits you listed have been appealed, and how many of those have been in good-faith, getting their subreddit restored, given that it appears that most of these bans were done automatically rather than manually.

In addition, do you believe the number of false bans are going down as you improve your new-sub scanner, and how many bans that haven’t been appealed might have been a mistake. Are there humans reviewing random samples of the banned subs, for example?",14

Thank you so much for this transparency in your process and in the overview of how much content on Reddit is hateful material, and the efforts to combat it.

The 8% report rate by users is frustratingly low - identifying and eliminating pain points on reporting hateful content should be a priority, in my opinion.

Currently, to report hateful material to a moderator is **_five clicks_** / taps.

To report hateful material to the admins directly is 8+ clicks / taps - including for a moderator to escalate an issue to admins.

Reducing the ""paperwork"" for both the average user to report hateful material, and for moderators to escalate that material to admins for violations of Sitewide rule 1, will drive more reporting and better reporting.

---

There's also a perception that not enough is done to shut down accounts posting clearly hateful material - as an example, moderators / users have experienced lately reporting accounts for several instances of blatant racial hatred - and have seen those accounts not be suspended. Sometimes they are promptly suspended - sometimes they're not. 

Both of these go back to the difficulty in recruiting people to report hatred - that's always going to be a challenge, since it's something people don't want to see in the first place, don't want to go looking for, and definitely don't want to make it their purpose in life to combat.

Finding ways to combat the perception / reputation of Reddit not addressing hatred and not taking reporting seriously / handling reports promptly, will take work.

Sometimes hate can be very overt, other times it can be more subtle. In other circumstances, historically marginalized groups may reclaim language and use it in a way that is acceptable for them, but unacceptable for others to use. Additionally, people are weirdly creative about how to be mean to each other. They evolve their language to make it challenging for outsiders (and models) to understand. All that to say that hateful language is inherently nuanced, but we should not let perfect be the enemy of good. We will continue to evolve our ability to understand hate and abuse at scale. 

This is very worth highlighting, and so important because it will never be totally possible to 100% automate this process, or even to rely on outsourced human content reviewers following simple guidelines. 

Take a recent example I'm sure AEO is familiar with right now - a certain anime related community had (well, seems to still be having) a debacle over banning a certain transphobic slur, one widely considered by I'd say the majority of trans people to be hateful or at the very least, deeply dehumanizing, but hotly debated within the anime fandom. Angry users have used the uproar over the ban as an excuse to perpetuate transphobic harassment or scapegoat trans subreddits (esp. the one I moderate). To make matters more confusing, the slur is also a word which can also be used in totally benign and unrelated contexts. Someone who isn't trans/isn't well versed in trans issues and doesn't watch anime would have *no idea* what I'm talking about but it's been dominating trans and anime Reddit for weeks. People have repeatedly sent me one-word comments and PMs with just that one slur (and often a variety of other slurs/harassment, of course, comes with the territory tbh) but since it's virtually unknown outside the trans and anime spheres, it probably wouldn't even be recognized as hate speech by human AEO reviewers who aren't already up on what it is and what it means. I've reported some when I've had time (since I'm usually on mobile, the process of reporting multiple sitewide violations at once isn't very streamlined in my client so regrettably sometimes my priority is just remove and ban and move on when there are a lot of things I need to do at once, and because of the high number of ""we have resolved the issue"" comments as opposed to ""we have taken action under out Content Policy"" responses I get on borderline cases they're low-priority for me)

on that note: a thing I would LOVE to see is a batch report feature for these kinds of things. That is, a page with as many fields as I need for all the links to all sorts of harassing/rule-breaking content, since these types of posts and comments do usually come in batches, whether because it's one problem user or whether it's because of a brigade or coordinated action. This would make reporting to admins so much faster and easier and I would be more likely to have the time and energy to report those ""borderline"" cases if I could report all of a user's problematic content at once to give the reviewer a better context of their behavior.",14

BTW all of these are from just yesterday's posts.  Things got a little excited because a Hindu temple was built on the same land the Babri Masjid (mosque) used to be on until it got demolished by Hindu supremacist fanatics.

RIP my account and karma.  Probably won't be able to use it after this.  I don't trust these religious fanatics.   Apologies for any grammatical errors; English is not my first language.  Guten Tag.

Would this involve improving/creating tools like the current new.reddit regex rules (making more complex filters easier to use/access), or would this be something completely new (akin to some popular user-made bots)? 

Although I like making filters/Autmoderator rules etc, I get why reddit is moving away from developing more features for it (or at least, appears to be). It can be daunting to learn how to code it, and using new.reddit tools are likely going to be easier to understand by more people.

It was probably one of the last hold-outs on the internet that didn't feel the need to curate the world's information for it's users and instead let them curate their own content with a community centered approach to content moderation. 

Your former CEO Yishan Wong literally made the statement:

>""We stand for free speech. This means we are not going to ban distasteful subreddits. We will not ban legal content even if we find it odious or if we personally condemn it.""

Well, you have started doing exactly that, even going as far as banning very large political groups and conspiracy groups. Once you start banning things that are not illegal, you open a Pandora's box. You are now the editor for all opinions and information on reddit - you are the arbiter of what is considered acceptable content. 

You have banned subreddits that sell guns - a literal constitutional right of all law abiding adult americans. 

You have banned subreddits that make fun of people who are fat. Is it nice? No, but it's pretty unreddit-like to be unwilling to tolerate a fat joke. 

You have banned subreddits dedicated to hacking and modification of games and entertainment equipment purely from corporate pressure. 

You literally banned the subreddit dedicated to the President of the United States and his followers (of whom I am not a fan), but you did it literally because it was inconvenient for you. They were literally banned for ""antagonizing the company"". 

Tl;dr - Don't try and convince everyone that this blatant censorship is in their best interest. Reddit and it's leadership are frankly just being weak and going down the same rabbithole that Facebook and Twitter have gone down - which may end up with everyone losing access to the modern internet as we know it. 

You are complicit in ruining the free and open internet and I am tired of everyone telling us how it is for our own good. It's not. It's for \*\*your\*\* own good. You are refusing to have a backbone and stand up for the principles that reddit was founded on - free and open expression with community led content moderation. 

You are bowing to corporate and Government interests to try and move the unseemly things from our sight. Well, frankly, we deserve to see those unseemly things so we can make up our own minds on how unseemly they are - IE, we want more than just your insecure CEO's opinion on a given issue.

What are you doing about the moderators of these subreddits and their more active users?  Are they being suspended and having their accounts actioned?

How often are you sharing warning messages to users that post or interact positively with hateful content?

Are you tracking the time it takes to respond to these reports?  I have noticed my reports on certain subreddits are being acted on almost immediately, while reports in others still takes a week or two.  Do certain subreddits, like those that are quarantined, have a higher priority?

Are you taking efforts to track where members of these hateful communities shift to once their hate sub is banned?

We believe in the power of community; where a small group of individuals (us) may be wrong, a larger group has a better chance of getting it right.

Have you had instances where the majority got it wrong.

Reddit has had demographic surveys done before.  The userbase of reddit isn't really a snapshot of the world at large.

In times where we have controversial issues that prompt discussion, how do you ensure that you are actually cracking down on legitimate ""hate"" and not repressing speech on a topic in general?

For instance:  Almost any post that criticizes BLM, whether it's a post about some controversial statements that leaders have made or coverage of protestors running over and beating a racoon to death are reported under the ""targeting a marginalized group"" report reason.

There are obviously other issues that a society wants to discuss... but I'm seeing that when they are discussed, people are using the ""targeting a minority"" reason on the comments that they disagree with that are not hate.

So... I guess the question is, how are you going to stop the crackdown on hate speech from becoming a crackdown on legal expression of concerns about controversial issues?",6

Right now it is very much an opt-in system that punishes the victim by forcing them to initiate while removing their ability to warn others about the abusive behavior of the blocked user. You may have 50 people all blocking the same user, and not only do they not know about the others, thereby making them feel alone and isolated, but they also never receive feedback on whether or not the blocked user has been banned or otherwise moderated as a result of their bad behavior.

I would like to see a system where users can be flagged as abusive which will prevent direct messages, but still keep their profiles visible, as well as posts, just with notation (perhaps like ""spoiler"" text, but maybe in red) so that users who like to keep track of the abusers can do so more easily. Furthermore, users who are flagged as abusive by multiple other users should generate a report to the mods and admins so that they can be more easily investigated.

There is a pattern of violence against landlords on this site and others, which has sometimes spilled over into the real world with fatal consequences.

Furthermore, it is not an 'occupation that one can freely opt into or out of.' If you have a mortgage, you are very much tied into that arrangement, and cannot just up and leave (like you can if you rent, for example). There is an increasing wave of hate directed at people who own property, and an increasing radicalization on this website. There are many people who simply made a sound investment to provide for their families, and do not deserve these vile attacks and intimidation. As others have mentioned, landlord has historically been a vulnerable identity, sometimes to the point of being targeted for mass murder.

All people deserve respect and security from violence. If you're not part of the solution, you're part of the problem.",0

That's just a straight up lie, and just going through the front page of reddit and reading the posts and comments, makes it very obvious.

Reddit doesnt care, neither about free speech nor hate speech. 10 years ago, maybe it did, at least about free speech, but nowadays that's just not the case. 

I am not an American. I've never been to the US and I have 0 desire to go there. I have no bone to pick in this race. But I did follow the 2016 election and results, so let me ask you this:

Do you honestly, honestly, believe ~50% of the country are quite literally the devil, because that is pretty much what reddit is leading people to believe nowadays.

It is pretty obvious reddit only cares about their investors and what their investors want. Hate speech doesnt matter, it never mattered and never will. It's nothing more than a hoax term used as an excuse to control what is visible on the platform. **Reddit doesnt care about hate speech. Don't ever for a second fool yourself that it does.**

There are still some [remnants of when things were different](https://www.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043066452-Is-posting-someone-s-private-or-personal-information-okay-) but at least the main rules page makes it somewhat clear that free speech is not really something reddit is interested in given the incredible prominence, subjectivity general language of Rule 1.

As a for-instance -- the model I use in conjunction with my work on /r/AgainstHateSubreddits breaks down types of hatred and harassment roughly equivalent to the ontology Reddit is using - but also, with respect to (for example) White Supremacist Extremism (an internal category I track), that has expressions in **_every_** other category - hatred based on religion, political compartment, gender, sexuality, ability, and with violent tendencies. They also specifically and _pointedly_ instruct their adherents to _hide_ the fact that they're White Supremacists - they tell them to ""hide their power levels"" and eschew specific distinctive signals that separate their efforts from the efforts of any other more-specifically-focused / ""legitimate"" political / social  / cultural movements.

They know that people will reject them if they're openly identified as the KKK / neoNazis / violent white supremacists - so they do things that obscure that connection.

Does that seem a little heavy a burden?

Now imagine that someone demanding ""proof"" doesn't define what they would consider ""proof"".

Further, imaging that someone demanding ""proof"" could -- if they so desired -- _easily locate mountains of proof_.

---
Denial and the demand for ""proof"" is artificial rhetoric.

What do I mean by this? Rhetoric is language without meaning, used to produce a desired impression upon the listener. Rhetoric is commonly employed in politics and advertising, where it is used to persuade -- rather than to inform, or construct, or solve.

Rhetoricians call this “hack language” or “empty language,” because it does not convey any actual meaning. It forwards a _goal_ - a goal which is often adversarial to the goals of the audience.

The person I responded to opened with ""misinformation is an even bigger issue on reddit [than hatred and harassment]"" -- 

while it's certainly true that misinformation is a big issue on Reddit, saying that it is ""a bigger problem on Reddit than hatred / harassment"" it is a Perfect World or Nirvana Fallacy -- It's ""What about what happened to **_ME_**?"", aka Derailment.

The person I responded to has what's known as a _specified definition_ of ""misinformation"" -- a code word, by which he means ""information that doesn't jibe with what I believe"". 

When he writes ""now several thousand people believe something that's factually untrue"" ----- there's a lot of propaganda about LGBTQ+ people and African-American people that circulates in specific cultures - propaganda which purports to be ""truthful"" and ""scientific"", but which is neither, and is a fig leaf for an intent to dehumanise, harass, and harm LGBTQ+ and/or African-American people. Guess which culture he is from? Hint: ""Based"", as in his name, is a shibboleth of that culture. One of the strongholds of that culture on the Internet recently migrated offsite -- and their subreddit, after 4 years of being _the_ primary driver of LGBTQ+ and African-American hatred and harassment on and off Reddit, was shuttered a few weeks ago.

""there's significant hate against law enforcement that's never acted upon."" -- the subreddit I referenced earlier was quarantined for hosting a plot to assassinate law enforcement and sitting American politicians.

""What about r/AgainstHateSubreddits this is ironically a hate subreddit"" is outright libel, only topped by ""They [AHS] make a comment with alt account, screenshot it and go trying to get subreddits banned.""

* Claims that ""misinformation"" is a bigger problem than hatred and harassment; Ironically engages in misinformation.

* Hits the ""Derail"" so hard that the pinball table went into Tilt mode.

Bad faith trolls - rhetoricians all - know that people fall for specific rhetorical tricks.

Until people stop falling for them, they'll keep using them, and keep getting away with their hatred and harassment.",3

If you haven't read it yet, you should. While it's truish that admins haven't publicly stated exactly the words I just wrote, it's pretty easy to read between the lines (or read what's directly written) that the policy is intended to not be weaponized against the people the admins are trying to protect by bad-faith arguments about things like what the definition of racism is. I know this is frustrating for you; I'm not trying to argue what's wrong or right here, as we both already know where we stand on that. I'm just sharing my knowledge of the intent behind the policies and how the admins will enforce them. And their intent is to protect historically marginalized and oppressed groups rather than use, say, the Supreme Court's interpretation of discrimination, which is applied to protect white people too. Agree with that or not, them's the facts.

You can also look to redtaboo and chtorrr's discussions with TERFs in modsupport about their subs getting banned where these two female admins let people know in no uncertain terms that according to reddit policy, ""trans women are women."" This is used to answer the question about whether cis women are going to be protected from trans women by reddit policy (the implicit question; not the explicit one) but I'm sure you are well aware what that sentence signals in terms of politics.

But there are still ways to codify law that disallows the propogation of hate speech while still maintaining principles of free speech.

""I got banned from r/news for quoting an article about how every anti-Semitic attack in NYC in the past 22 months hasn’t been done by anyone that is right wing, and said “20$ says this turns out to be a hoax”.

When I questioned the moderator by replying to the ban via PM, asking why I get banned for pointing that out but not the people immediately claiming it’s done by a Trump supporter, I was muted. Quality moderating, Reddit. I wish there was a way to report mod abuse.

Of course not even a day later (I actually think it was less than a few hours) it turns out it was done by a gay black liberal activist who worked for the Obama campaign.  Color me shocked.

---

-- BeefySleet, in /r/The_Donald, November 2018, presumably in reference to Grafton Thomas' attack on an ultra-Orthodox rabbi's home, which was motivated by mental illness (per recent court rulings); Grafton Thomas was not gay, not an activist, and did not work for Obama's campaign.

Only comment by BeefySleet in /r/news containing the word ""Jews""


---
---

""I said nothing about conspiracies, I was merely pointing out that based on population, that Jews have a disproportionately large amount of wealth, and make up a very high percentage of top wealthy people. 

This was in response to someone claiming that all white people control the wealth or some other nonsense like that. ""

Another hit that came up while researching the validity of the ""I was banned from /r/news"" claim

---
---

""Nothing they said in this thread is racist. I'm not a weirdo who goes and digs through months of old post history to find some comment that fits my narrative. I don't know why the left always does this, they don't put up a reply to a given argument. They just check post histories and whine about someone posting on t_d or whatever else they can find and then never actually make a proper counter argument.""

---

Nothing about 22 months, or the Monsey attack - lots of anti-Semitic talking points ... No mention of $20, or a hoax ... (and the Monsey attack wasn't a hoax) ...

Last comment in /r/news, and therefore likely the one you were banned for:

""**_IF_** that happened, where's the **proof**?"".

Most people demanding ""proof"" do not specify what would satisfy them as ""proof"". They then proceed to ""move the goalposts"" - 

the initial demand for ""proof"" is a rhetorical trick, designed to elicit a relationship between the person demanding ""proof"" and the person attempting to provide that proof.

It's bad faith.

It's a signature of, for instance:

The historical campaign by a Dow Chemical researcher to deny that tetraethyllead petrol fuel additive caused lead poisoning;  

The historical campaign by tobacco executives to deny that tobacco consumption causes various cancers and other health problems;  

The historical campaign by asbestos industry executives to deny that asbestos causes cancer;  

The historical campaign by various industries to deny that specific aerosolised off-gasses / escaped refrigerants / carbon dioxide / methane drives anthropogenic global warming;  

The historical campaign by various industries to deny that anthropogenic global warming is anthropogenic;  

The historical campaign by various industries to deny that anthropogenic global warming is occurring;

I fully understand why conservatives on reddit are feeling scared that all dissenting viewpoints that aren't super liberal are going to start getting censored. And I agree that conservatives *should* have a place to talk about their ideas, and that talking things through with compassion and outreach is a great way to combat hate that can and does work.

However I would challenge you and anybody who feels conservatives are being pushed off the site why it is that banning ""hate speech"" is banning conservative thought. The conservatives I know would eschew the idea that things like denying the holocaust or defending the practice of slavery are ""conservative viewpoints"" because they don't want their political views affiliated with hateful ideology. I can understand the ""slippery slope"" fear that it's only a matter of time before r/conservative gets the boot too, and if that happens I'll be there with you decrying it, but I don't personally forsee that happening the way some people fear.

As for the issue of reaching out compassionately, there are spaces where this is possible and spaces where it's not. In real life, I have friends who hold detestable views about women, minorities, and LGBTQ people. I've known these people since childhood. Over the years I've helped them temper their hatred and helped them learn to see other human beings as different but not scary. On reddit there are also spaces that try to help educate people out of hatred -- /r/AskHistorians has a number of great meta posts explaining how they approach topics like holocaust denialism and the like, and why they have to moderate their sub so strictly -- they find that the ""group consensus"" provided by upvotes and downvotes on what the ""best answer"" is, is very often wrong and poorly informed if they don't control the top-level comments visible.

Obviously AskHistorians is an EXTREME example of ""censorship"" on reddit and not every sub can have a team of historians writing essays to dispell hateful narratives. There are other subs dedicated to helping deradicalize people, too, like /r/MensLib trying to help incels redirect their hatred of women into bettering themselves and try to think of women as people again.

But the subreddits that reddit removed weren't those subreddits. They weren't communities devoted to the free exchange of ideas and helping educate and uplift each other. They were communities devoted to *promoting* hateful ideologies, which actively shared lies, half-truths, propaganda, and hate speech to encourage hating their targets more fervently. They were communities that would ban people who would try to help these people learn to be less hateful. The spaces that reddit removed were not helping get rid of hate speech; they were actively trying to grow it. They were like a gangrenous wound on Reddit's foot, and the whole foot needed to be amputated so the infection didn't spread across the rest of the body.",3

No, but somewhat similar, the big difference is that saferbot silences an undesirable user for everyone, whereas what I'm suggesting lets the undesirable user speak and lets those who find them undesirable to hide them from their own view.

Imagine if you could subscribe to saferbot across your entire reddit experience, having it filter out former users of the_donald across every subreddit you view.  They don't get censored, you don't get triggered.

You could think of it a lot like blocklists on twitter, something you opt into that controls only your own experience and only by your own choice.

That's the biggest difference between how reddit currently handles moderation and what I suggest, maximizing end user freedom and choice.

If reddit wanted to designate all of the subs it banned as hateful and gave end users the option to block those labeled subs from their experience (even making this the default) it would not be nearly censorious as what happened to subs like r/ChapoTrapHouse and r/The_Donald

Being able to individually exclude subreddits from r/all is a great feature, having reddit forcefully exclude certain communities from r/**ALL** (heavy emphasis on ALL here) for everyone via quarantine/ban is not.",5

No.  It doesn't.  This isn't about people who have completed transition.

You have many in the trans community now saying that they are trans but that they don't intend to transition.

And you have people who are gender fluid saying that they won't transition.

Most people are very understanding and know that there are people who are trans, who want to transition and have no issue with them using public bathrooms.

The issue comes when NOW we decide that based on being understanding and wanting to be compassionate and allow trans individuals to use the correct locker room or area where people are sometimes naked and exposed to others...this new ""gender fluid"" group is also allowed to use the same facility.

And a national conversation about this has not happened, because the conversation is PREVENTED because people just scream, ""TERF BIGOT"" and shut it down.

There are some of us out here who know about the truscum versus tucute debate.

For years we've been told that dysphoria is crippling and the TREATMENT for it is transition.  Now we're being told that people might just decide that that they are trans without any dysphoria being present and maybe they won't even move towards transition...but we have to accept that they are trans.

And this gets even MORE complicated when you have people insisting that a straight man SHOULD be willing to be attracted to someone with a penis if that person identifies as female.  Or that a straight woman should be willing to be with a person with a vagina if that person identifies as a man...otherwise it is bigotry.

You have now situations like this:

https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/kristi-hanna-human-rights-complaint-transgender-woman-toronto-shelter

And this makes women feel as though the compassion only goes one way and compassion for how THEY feel as abuse survivors is not important.

In that story the transwoman was pre op... and attracted to women.  So this rape survivor was put in a room with a person with a penis who was attracted to women.

And we aren't even allowed to suggest that this is a problem.

Or we're TERFbigots.

And that's when women begin to say, ""Okay...I think that transwomen definitely deserve to have places where they can be safe and get help...but that other ciswoman's feelings matter, too.  She's an abuse survivor.  And it seems like the system gave her a big, ""f- you, bigot"" at a time that her feelings were equally as important.",1

If this is the case, then providing the facilities and tools for users to avoid seeing this content will avoid any such silencing effect without having to censor those saying things that offend others.

Also, you could make the same argument that when content on reddit gets censored, it affects people who oppose censorship when they find out about it and makes them less willing to participate in reddit.  This solution has the same effect as the problem it is supposed to be solving.

> Other subreddits, meaning people are less likely to see copious amounts of hate, are more likely to feel welcome

Yes.  I can find, right now, LOTS of examples of really rank hatred of Christians.

Thing is, reddit tolerates it.

It was the closest thing to a coherent and clearly expressed rationale behind the changes I could find.  I'm open to alternative reasoning if you can point to it.

> I respect your desire to support free speech, but as you've agreed that hate speech is bad, and I'm sure you agree that growing hate groups like white supremacists is bad, I want to know what you think is a reasonable way for reddit to approach content that is liable to turn people into white supremacists.

Supporting individual freedom means supporting the freedom of others to do things you find detestable.

For example, I don't condone taking heroin, I think it's a dangerous substance that should be avoided but I do oppose its criminalization.

Similarly I don't condone the use of slurs and hate speech, but I think attempting to enforce restrictions on speech impairs freedom and that freedom is more desirable than safety, especially when the danger we're referring to is merely words and images on a screen.

I'll point out one good move I think reddit made against hate, and that is the forced sidebar propaganda added to quarantined subreddits.  I oppose everything else about the quarantine system, but I can only support reddit in speaking out against and linking to resources to help others escape hateful groups.

As you say it is possible to be anti hate speech and pro-free speech, but to do so requires that we not resort to censorship.",4

This isn't about people who have completed transition.

So a trans woman who just came out is a man?

>You have many in the trans community now saying that they are trans but that they don't intend to transition.

Where are they? And does that mean what u think it means, or does it rather mean people who know about themself being trans but staying in the closet because of society's repercussions? After all transitioning from mtf isn't just shaving and wearing a dress, transitioning means living ur life as a woman, whatever that means. So if a person decides to not do that, where exactly is ur problem? Why the hell would they use the bathroom that doesn't fit their AGAB, when they intend to stay in the fucking closet?

>Most people are very understanding and know that there are people who are trans, who want to transition and have no issue with them using public bathrooms.

Well, most left leaning people anyway. The conservative's not so much. And if they say that, then there's always a catch. That can then either be that they respect trans folk, but u just don't meet their arbitrary standard of what a woman has to look like and so they are only supporting in theory. Or they are the types who say trans folk aren't actually the gender they say they are, but they'll entertain their beliefs until the trans person can't hear them anymore or until it's time to vote against LGBT rights again. They are dishonest.

Also, u have already contradicted urself and we're not even halfway through ur text.

>This isn't about people who have completed transition.

>who want to transition and have no issue with them using public bathrooms.

So what now? Is this trans woman who just came out now a woman, or a man? Or is she in some kind of limbo? Or is she whatever fits ur argument best at a certain time?

>The issue comes when NOW we decide that based on being understanding and wanting to be compassionate and allow trans individuals to use the correct locker room or area where people are sometimes naked and exposed to others...this new ""gender fluid"" group is also allowed to use the same facility.

Why are we taking about genderfluid people right now, in a discussion on wether or not trans women are women? Did u just notice ur arguments are shit and started deflecting? And besides that, who exactly gets harmed when we allow to let people use the bathrooms they want to use? There is no evidence that this leads to cis women or cis men getting sexually abused/harrassed by trans women or trans men. That's just not a thing that happens. In fact, the people getting harrassed in bathrooms are the transgender folk and cis women who don't dress feminine enough and who are they getting harrassed by? That's right, cis people. It's so incredibly stupid to assume a predatory men who wants to abuse or harrass women in bathrooms would have to fake being trans in order to do so, abuse and harrassment is already illegal. Also, as cis men they'd likely get away with it far easier too, it makes no sense that they'd give up their position of privilege and power to abuse women.

>For years we've been told that dysphoria is crippling and the TREATMENT for it is transition.  Now we're being told that people might just decide that that they are trans without any dysphoria being present and maybe they won't even move towards transition...but we have to accept that they are trans.

People feel dysphoric about how they present, so transitioning means trying to alleviate that by more closely matching what they perceive they should be like. That doesn't necessarily have to be what *u* want them to present like, they still have or are transitioning to a point where *they* feel good about themselves.

But I still don't get why we're talking about gender nonconforming people now?

And dysphoria doesn't have to be present or immediately obvious to oneself in order to be trans. Because the opposite of gender dysphoria, is gender euphoria and if people experience that when they look more like the opposite gender or androgynous, then why shouldn't that be valid? Some trans people have also said they that they didn't feel dysphoria in the beginning, but once they started investigating their feelings in therapy, noticed that it was just hidden from themselves. Others said that they only learned that what they feel is dysphoria, when they experienced gender euphoria for the first time. And then there are some that said they only started feeling intense dysphoria, once they started transitioning, because before that, they didn't give a crap how they looked, because it didn't fit their true gender anyway and only once they tried to pass as their gender, they started feeling dysphoria.

> And this gets even MORE complicated when you have people insisting that a straight man SHOULD be willing to be attracted to someone with a penis if that person identifies as female.  Or that a straight woman should be willing to be with a person with a vagina if that person identifies as a man...otherwise it is bigotry.

No one says that. This is a far right strawman and baseless fear mongering.

>...it affects trans people's willingness to participate in reddit, **even if that content gets removed.**

the most effective way of making sure such hate doesn't affect the users of the site, is creating an environment where it isn't said in the first place. that is done not by giving more removal tools, but by banning the subreddits that act as the hubs for hatred.

i would argue that ""people who are against censorship"" don't exist in a vacuum - they exist within the context of the content they would allow to be posted - and by that token they're little different from the people actively posting hateful content in allowing users targeted by the hate to be scared away",5

the first story happened at an event organized by members of the Proud Boys (a white supremacist group) and Invaders Motorcycle Club (a white nationalist motorcycle gang). the man in the header photo is a member of the KKK, and the reason he's in an altercation is because his buddy said so. whatever your opinion is on assaulting KKK members, it's clear he was assaulted for that, and not for being a catholic

i cant find any additional context on the second story, so assuming the report is accurate, sure, that is pretty terrible to hear about

however, the third article also makes it clear that it is not the faith of the church that's being objected to here. from the article: ""The Grace Baptist Church Facebook page frequently posts clips of sermons with titles like 'Stop celebrating black history month,' 'Every Muslim is a terrorist' and 'Jews have ruined America...'"" again, saying stuff like that is Not a core tenet of Christianity.

so, like, maybe there are some people attacking christians for their faith? but two of the three examples you've chosen are demonstrably just people objecting to really hateful messages, and the people spreading those messages trying to use their faith as a shield from criticism",2

The point of the example was to show that whether you support something or not is nuanced.

I don't think people should have the personal freedom to do things that infringe upon other people's lives/freedom.

Shooting up heroin is closer to saying something offensive online than it is to murdering someone else because I can ignore and avoid the needle in your arm or the slurs you direct at me without incident but this not the case if you choose to shoot me.

I wasn't trying to bring up criminalization with this example either, simply that supporting someone having the choice to do something is not the same as supporting all the potential choices they might make.",2

I think most people SHOULD think that violence and burning buildings in response to being offended is wrong.

But I guess a lot of people don't.

>with ""ive seen it a lot on reddit, just trust me bro.""

Okay... you know you have seen it, too, right?

It's pretty common to see people say, ""Evangelical Christians are a death cult and are a domestic terror threat.""

But if you changed the religion to any other, it would be hate speech.

We're talking ABOUT reddit, specifically.  I can FIND you the examples, but I think you know what I'm talking about.

>i know there are instances of crimes targetting any number of different groups, and we could talk about that for any amount of time, but i've really lost confidence in your ability to argue in good faith, sorry to say.

I think I've been fairly civil here and have tried to explain, but if you'd rather not discuss it and prefer instead to say that I'm not discussing in good faith, that's up to you.

I checked that post. The OP has exactly 1 post in PCM (which says ""based"" and nothing else), and exactly 1 post in AHS, on a post relating /r/tucker_carlson, reading:

> He yelled ‘I can’t breathe’ before he had a cop kneeling on his neck though. Not trying to justify his death, just want to point it out.

That comment was never approved, so it is only visible on his profile. If you comb through his profile, you will quickly see 2 things:

1. His most active subs are EDM/avicii/tressless.

2. It's clearly a throwaway/not very active account and only a month old.

With all that said, I dont see how anyone can reasonably claim he was part of a ""PCM brigade"" based on his post history, unless they have some other information I don't.
