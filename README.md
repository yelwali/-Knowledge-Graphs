# Personalized Knowledge Graphs

This project focuses on building personalized knowledge graphs to enhance the contextualization of communications. The system captures user-specific data, including background, interaction patterns, and inferred personality traits, providing a foundation for more accurate and meaningful communication.

## Features

- **User Background Representation**: Collects and organizes user background information.
- **Interaction Patterns**: Analyzes and incorporates user behavior and communication styles.
- **Personality Traits**: Infers personality traits to adapt communication dynamically.
- **Enhanced Contextualization**: Leverages knowledge graphs for tailored communication insights.

## Use Cases

- **Improved Communication Systems**: Enhance understanding in chatbots, virtual assistants, and customer support systems.
- **Social Media Analysis**: Detect patterns in user interactions for targeted recommendations or content moderation.
- **Behavioral Analysis**: Study user behavior for applications in marketing, education, or healthcare.

## Streamlit User Interface (UI)

The project also includes an interactive UI built with **Streamlit** for real-time monitoring and analysis. The UI allows analysts to visualize knowledge graphs, monitor flagged content, and receive alerts based on real-time analysis of user interactions and behaviors.

### UI Features:
- **Knowledge Graph Visualization**: Displays relationships and connections between flagged entities, highlighting suspicious nodes.
- **Behavioral Analysis**: Provides insights into user behaviors, such as anomalies in activity or content sharing patterns.
- **Real-Time Alerts**: Sends notifications to analysts based on detected suspicious activities or flagged content.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Key libraries: `Streamlit`, `NetworkX`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn` (for behavioral analysis)
### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yelwali/-Knowledge-Graphs.git
   cd -Knowledge-Graphs
   ```

2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install streamlit networkx matplotlib scikit-learn
   ```

### Running the Streamlit App

To launch the application, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
streamlit run Comments Monitoring and Alert System.py
```

This will open the app in your default web browser, where you can interact with the knowledge graph, analyze behavioral patterns, and manage alerts.

### UI Overview:
- **Knowledge Graph Section**: Visualizes entities and their relationships.
- **Flagged Content Section**: Displays content that has been flagged based on predefined criteria.
- **Alerts Section**: Provides real-time alerts and allows filtering by alert severity.

## Additional Features

- **Behavioral Analysis**: The UI allows you to filter flagged content based on behavioral insights and suspicious activity.
- **Interactive Graph Exploration**: Use Streamlit's dynamic components to interact with the graph and explore user connections.
- **Real-Time Notifications**: Receive real-time notifications of flagged content and suspicious activities.
